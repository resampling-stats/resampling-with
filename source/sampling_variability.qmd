# On Variability in Sampling

*\[Debra said\]: "I've had such good luck with Japanese cars and poor
luck with American\..."*

*The '65 Ford Mustang: "It was fun, but I had to put two new
transmissions in it."*

*The Ford Torino: "That got two transmissions too. That finished me with
Ford."*

*The Plymouth Horizon: "The disaster of all disasters. That should've
been painted bright yellow. What a lemon."*

( *Washington Post Magazine* , May 17, 1992, p. 19)

Does the headnote above convince you that Japanese cars are better than
American? Has Debra got enough evidence to reach the conclusion she now
holds? That sort of question, and the reasoning we use to address it ,
is the subject of this chapter.

More generally, how should one go about using the available data to test
the hypothesis that Japanese cars are better? That is an example of the
questions that are the subject of statistics.

## Variability and small samples

Perhaps the most important idea for sound statistical inference — the
section of the book we are now beginning, in contrast to problems in
probability, which we have studied in the previous chapters — is
recognition of the *presence of variability in the results of small
samples* . The fatal error of relying on too-small samples is all too
common among economic forecasters, journalists, and others who deal with
trends and public opinion. Athletes, sports coaches, sportswriters, and
fans too frequently disregard this principle both in their decisions and
in their discussion.

Our intuitions often carry us far astray when the results vary from
situation to situation — that is, when there is variability in
outcomes — and when we have only a small sample of outcomes to look at.

To motivate the discussion, I'll tell you something that almost no
American sports fan will believe: There is no such thing as a slump in
baseball batting. That is, a batter often goes an alarming number of
at-bats without getting a hit, and everyone — the manager, the
sportswriters, and the batter himself — assumes that something has
changed, and the probability of the batter getting a hit is now lower
than it was before the slump. It is common for the manager to replace
the player for a while, and for the player and coaches to change the
player's hitting style so as to remedy the defect. But the chance of a
given batter getting a hit is just the same after he has gone many
at-bats without a hit as when he has been hitting well. A belief in
slumps causes managers to play line-ups which may not be their best.

By "slump" I mean that a player's probability of getting a hit in a
given at-bat is lower during a period than during average periods. And
when I say there is no such thing as a slump, I mean that the chances of
getting a hit after any sequence of at-bats without a hit is *not*
different than the long-run average.

The "hot hand" in basketball is another illusion. The hot hand does not
exist! The chance of a shooter scoring is the same after he has just
missed a flock of shots as when he has just sunk a long string. That is,
the chance of scoring a basket is no higher after a run of successes
than after a run of failures. But even professional teams choose plays
on the basis of who supposedly has a hot hand.

Managers who substitute for the "slumping" or "cold-handed" players with
other players who, in the long run, have lower batting averages, or set
up plays for the shooter who supposedly has a hot hand, make a mistake.
The supposed hot hand in basketball, and the slump in baseball, are
illusions because the observed long runs of outs, or of baskets, are
statistical artifacts, due to ordinary random variability. The
identification of slumps and hot hands is superstitious behavior,
classic cases of the assignment of pattern to a series of events when
there really is no pattern.

How do statisticians ascertain that slumps and hot hands do not exist?
In brief, in baseball we simulate a hitter with a given average — say
.250 — and compare the results with actual hit-

ters of that average, to see whether they have "slumps" longer than the
computer. The method of investigation is roughly as follows. You program
a computer or other machine to behave the way a player would, given the
player's long-run average, on the assumption that each trial is a random
drawing. For example, if a player has a .250 season-long batting
average, the machine is programmed like a bucket containing three black
balls and one white ball. Then for each simulated at bat, the machine
shuffles the "balls" and draws one; it then records whether the result
is black or white, after which the ball is replaced in the bucket. To study
a season with four hundred at-bats, a simulated ball is drawn four
hundred times.

The records of the player's real season and the simulated season are
then compared. If there really is such a thing as a non-random slump or
streak, there will be fewer but longer "runs" of hits or outs in the
real record than in the simulated record. On the other hand, if
performance is independent from at-bat trial to at-bat trial, the actual
record will change from hit to out and from out to hit as often as does
the random simulated record. I suggested this sort of test for the
existence of slumps in my 1969 book that first set forth the resampling
method, a predecessor of this book.

For example, Table 9-1 shows the results of one 400 at-bat season for a
simulated .250 hitter. (1 = hit, 0 = out, sequential atbats ordered
vertically) Note the "slump" — 1 for 24 — in columns 7 & 8 (in bold).

Harry Roberts investigated the batting records of a sample of major
leaguers. He compared players' season-long records against the behavior
of random-number drawings. If slumps existed rather than being a fiction
of the imagination, the real players' records would shift from a string
of hits to a string of outs less frequently than would the random-number
sequences. But in fact the number of shifts, and the average lengths of
strings of hits and outs, are on average the same for players as for
player-simulating random-number devices.

Over long periods, averages may vary systematically, as Ty Cobb's annual
batting averages varied non-randomly from season to season, Roberts
found. But in the short run, most individual and team performances have
shown results similar to the outcomes that a lottery-type random number
machine would produce.

Thomas Gilovich, Robert Vallone and Amos Twersky performed a similar
study of basketball shooting. They examined the records of shots from
the floor by the Philadelphia 76'ers, foul shots by the Boston Celtics,
and a shooting experiment of Cornell University teams. They found that
"basketball players and fans alike tend to believe that a player's
chance of hitting a shot are greater following a hit than following a
miss on the previous shot. However, detailed analyses...provided no
evidence for a positive correlation between the outcomes of successive
shots."

To put their conclusion differently, knowing whether a shooter has
scored or not scored on the previous shot — or in any previous sequence
of shots — is of absolutely no use in predicting whether the shooter
will or will not score on the next shot. Similarly, knowledge of the
past series of at-bats in baseball does not improve a prediction of
whether a batter will get a hit this time.

Of course a batter *feels* — and intensely — as if she or he has a
better chance of getting a hit at some times than at other times. After
a series of successful at-bats, both sandlot players and professionals
feel confident that this time will be a hit, too. And after you have hit
a bunch of baskets from all over the court, you feel as if you can't
miss.

But notice that cardplayers get the same poignant feeling of being "hot"
or "cold," too. After a poker player "fills" several straights and
flushes in a row, s/he feels s/he will hit the next one too. (Of course
there are some players who feel just the opposite, that the "law of
averages" is about to catch up with them.)

You will agree, I'm sure, that the cards don't have any memory, and a
player's chance of filling a straight or flush remains the same no
matter how he or she has done in the last series of hands. Clearly,
then, a person can have a strong feeling that something is about to
happen even when that feeling has no foundation. This supports the idea
that even though a player in sports "feels" that s/he is in a slump or
has a hot hand, this does not imply that the feeling has any basis in
reality.

Why, when a batter is low in his/her mind because s/he has been making a
lot of outs or for personal reasons, does her/ his batting not suffer?
And why the opposite? Apparently at any given moment there are many
influences operating upon a player's performance in a variety of
directions, with none of them clearly dominant. Hence there is no simple
convincing explanation why a player gets a hit or an out, a basket or a
miss, on any given attempt.

But though science cannot provide an explanation, the sports
commentators always are ready to offer their analyses. Listen, for
example, to how they tell you that Joe Zilch must have been trying extra
hard *just because of* his slump. There is a sportswriter's explanation
for *anything* that happens.

Why do we believe the nonsense we hear about "momentum," "comeback,"
"she's due this time," and so on? The adult of the human species has a
powerful propensity to believe that he or she can find a pattern even
when there is no pattern to be found. Two decades ago I cooked up series
of numbers with a random-number machine that looked as if they were
prices on the stock market. Subjects in the experiment were told to buy
and sell whichever stocks they chose. Then I gave them "another day's
prices," and asked them to buy and sell again. The subjects did all
kinds of fancy figuring, using an incredible variety of
assumptions — even though there was no way for the figuring to help
them. That is, people sought patterns even though there was no reason to
believe that there were any patterns to be found.

When I stopped the game before the ten buy-and-sell sessions the
participants expected, people asked that the game continue. Then I would
tell them that there was no basis for any patterns in the data.
"Winning" or "losing" had no meaning. But the subjects demanded to
continue anyway. They continued believing that they could find patterns
even after I told them that the numbers were randomly looked up and not
real stock prices.

The illusions in our thinking about sports have important counterparts
in our thinking about such real-world phenomena as the climate, the
stock market, and trends in the prices of raw materials such as mercury,
copper and wheat. And private and public decisions made on the basis of
faulty understanding of these real situations, caused by illusory
thinking on the order of belief in slumps and hot hands, are often
costly and sometimes disastrous.

An example of the belief that there are patterns when there are none:
Systems for finding patterns in the stock market are peddled that have
about the same reliability as advice from a racetrack tout — and
millions buy them.

One of the scientific strands leading into research on variability was
the body of studies that considers the behavior of stock prices as a
"random walk." That body of work asserts that a stock broker or chartist
who claims to be able to find patterns in past price movements of stocks
that will predict future movements should be listened to with about the
same credulity as a racetrack tout or an astrologer. A second strand was
the work in psychology in the last decade or two which has recognized
that people's estimates of uncertain events are systematically biased in
a variety of interesting and knowable ways.

The U.S. government has made — and continues to make — blunders costing
the public scores of billions of dollars, using slump-type fallacious
reasoning about resources and energy. Forecasts are issued and policies
are adopted based on the belief that a short-term increase in price
constitutes a long-term trend. But the "experts" employed by the
government to make such forecasts do no better on average than do
private forecasters, and often the system of forecasting that they use
is much more misleading than would be a random-number generating machine
of the sort used in the baseball slump experiments.

Please look at the data in Figure 9-2 for the height of the Nile River
over about half a century. Is it not natural to think that those data
show a decline in the height of the river? One can imagine that if our
modern communication technology existed then, the Cairo newspapers would
have been calling for research to be done on the fall of the Nile, and
the television anchors would have been warning the people to change
their ways and use less water.

Let's look at Figure 9-3 which represents the data over an even longer
period. What now would you say about the height of the Nile? Clearly the
"threat" was non-existent, and only appeared threatening because the
time span represented by the data was too short. The point of this
display is that looking at too-short a segment of experience frequently
leads us into error. And "too short" may be as long as a century.

Another example is the price of mercury, which is representative of all
metals. Figure 9-4 shows a forecast made in 1976 by natural-scientist
Earl Cook. He combined a then-recent upturn in prices with the notion
that there is a finite amount of mercury on the earth's surface, plus
the mathematical charm of plotting a second-degree polynomial with the
computer. Figures 9-5a and 9-5b show how the forecast was almost
immediately falsified, and the price continued its long-run decline.

Lack of sound statistical intuition about variability can lead to
manipulation of the public being by unscrupulous persons. Commodity
funds sellers use a device of this sort to make their results look good
( *The Washington Post* , Sep 28, 1987, p. 71). Some individual
commodity traders inevitably do well in their private trading, just by
chance. A firm then hires one of them, builds a public fund around him,
and claims the private record for the fund's own history. But of course
the private record has no predictive power, any more than does the
record of someone who happened to get ten heads in a row flipping coins.

How can we avoid falling into such traps? It is best to look at the
longest possible sweep of history. That is, use the largest possible
sample of observations to avoid sampling error. For copper we have data
going back to the 18th century B.C. In Babylonia, over a period of 1000
years, the price of iron fell to one fifth of what it was under
Hammurabi (almost 4000 years ago), and the price of copper then cost
about a thousand times its current price in the U.S., relative to wages.
So the inevitable short-run increases in price should be considered in
this long-run context to avoid drawing unsound conclusions due to
small-sample variability.

Proof that it is sound judgment to rely on the longest possible series
is given by the accuracy of predictions one would have made in the past.
In the context of copper, mercury, and other raw materials, we can refer
to a sample of years in the past, and from those years imagine ourselves
forecasting the following year. If you had bet every time that prices
would go down in consonance with the long-run trend, you would have been
a big winner on average.

## Regression to the mean

UP, DOWN "The Dodgers demoted last year's NL rookie of the year, OF Todd
Hollandsworth (.237, 1 HR, 18 RBI) to AAA Albuquerque\..." (Item in
*Washington Post* , 6/14/97)

It is a well-known fact that the Rookie of the Year in a sport such as
baseball seldom has as outstanding a season in her/his sophomore year.
Why is this so? Let's use the knowledge we have acquired of probability
and simulation to explain this phenomenon.

The matter at hand might be thought of as a problem in pure
probability — if one simply asks about the chance that a given player
(the Rookie of the Year) will repeat. Or it could be considered a
problem in statistics, as discussed in coming chapters. Let's consider
the matter in the context of baseball.

Imagine 10 mechanical "ball players," each a machine that has three
white balls (hits) and 7 black balls. Every time the machine goes to
bat, you take a ball out of the machine, look to see if it is a hit or
an out, and put it back. For each "ball player" you do this 100 times.
One of them is going to do better than the others, and that one becomes
the Rookie of the Year. (See Table 9-2.)

**Table 9-2**

**Rookie Seasons** (100 at bats)

  ---------------- ---------------------
  **\# of Hits**   **Batting Average**
  32               .320
  34               .340
  33               .330
  30               .300
  35               .350
  33               .330
  30               .300
  31               .310
  28               .280
  25               .250
  ---------------- ---------------------

Would you now expect that the player who happened to be the best among
the top ten in the first year to again be the best among the top ten in
the next year, also? The sports writers do. But of course this seldom
happens. The Rookie of the Year in major-league baseball seldom has as
outstanding a season in his sophomore year as in his rookie year. You
can expect him to do better than the average of all sophomores, but not
necessarily better than all of the rest of the group of talented players
who are now sophomores. (Please notice that we are not saying that there
is no long-run difference among the top ten rookies. But suppose there
is. Table 9-3 shows the season's performance for ten batters of
differing performances).

Table 9-3

**Season's Performance**

  ------------ ------------
  **"TRUE"**   **ROOKIE**
  .270         .340
  .270         .240
  .280         .330
  .280         .300
  .300         .280
  .300         .420
  .320         .340
  .320         .350
  .330         .260
  .330         .330
  ------------ ------------

We see from Figure 9-3 that we have ten batters whose "true" batting
averages range from .270 to .330. Their rookie year performance (400 at
bats), simulated on the basis of their "true"average is on the right.
Which one is the rookie of the year? It's \#6, who hit .420 during the
rookie session. Will he do as well next year? Not likely — his "true"
average is only

.300.

Try generating some rookie "seasons" yourself with the following
commands, ranging the batter's "true" performance by altering what you
count as a hit.

`           GENERATE 400 1,100 at-bats         `

`           COUNT at-bats <= 30 hits DIVIDE hits 400 average         `

Simulate a set of 10 or 20 such rookie seasons, and look at the one who
did best. How did his rookie season compare to his "true" average?

The explanation is the presence of *variability* . And lack of
recognition of the role of variability is at the heart of much
fallacious reasoning. Being alert to the role of variability is crucial.

Or consider the example of having a superb meal at a restaurant — the
best meal you have ever eaten. That fantastic meal is almost surely the
combination of the restaurant being better than average, plus a lucky
night for the chef and the dish you ordered. The next time you return
you can expect a meal better than average, because the restaurant is
better than average in the long run. But the meal probably will be less
good than the superb one you had the first time, because there is no
reason to believe that the chef will get so lucky again and that the
same sort of variability will happen this time.

These examples illustrate the concept of "regression to the mean" — a
confusingly-titled and very subtle effect caused by variability in
results among successive samples drawn from the same population. This
phenomenon was given its title more than a century ago by Francis
Galton, one of the great founders of modern statistics, when at first he
thought that the height of the human species was becoming more uniform,
after he noticed that the children of the tallest and shortest parents
usually are closer to the average of all people than their parents are.
But later he discovered his fallacy — that the variability in heights of
children of quite short and quite tall parents also causes some people
to be even more exceptionally tall or short than their parents. So the
spread in heights among humans remains much the same from generation to
generation; there is no "regression to the mean." The heart of the
matter is that any exceptional observed case in a group is likely to be
the result of two forces — a) an *underlying propensity* to differ from
the average in one direction or the other, plus b) *some chance sampling
variability* that happens (in the observed case) to push even further in
the exceptional direction.

A similar phenomenon arises in direct-mail marketing. When a firm tests
many small samples of many lists of names and then focuses its mass
mailings on the lists that performed best in the tests, the full list
"rollouts" usually do not perform as well as the samples did in the
initial tests. It took many years before mail-order experts (see
especially Burnett, Ed) finally understood that regression to the mean
*inevitably* causes an important part of the dropoff from sample to
rollout observed in the set of lists that give the very best results in
a multi-list test.

The larger the test samples, the less the dropoff, of course, because
larger samples reduce variability in results. But larger samples risk
more money. So the test-sample-size decision for the marketer inevitably
is a trade-off between accuracy and cost.

And one last amusing example: After I lectured to the class on this
material, the student who had gotten the best grade on the first
mid-term exam came up after class and said: "Does that mean that on the
second mid-term I should expect to do well but not the best in the
class?" And that's exactly what happened: He had the second-best score
in the class on the next midterm.

A related problem arises when one conducts multiple tests, as when
testing thousands of drugs for therapeutic value. Some of the drugs may
appear to have a therapeutic effect just by chance. We will discuss this
problem later when discussing hypothesis testing.

## Summary and conclusion

The heart of statistics is clear thinking. One of the key elements in
being a clear thinker is to have a sound gut understanding of
statistical processes and variability. This chapter amplifies this
point.

A great benefit to using simulations rather than formulas to deal with
problems in probability and statistics is that the presence and
importance of variability becomes manifest in the course of the
simulation work.
