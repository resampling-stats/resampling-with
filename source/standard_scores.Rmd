# Ranks, Quantiles and Standard Scores

Imagine we have a set of measures, in some particular units.  We may want some
way to see quickly how these measures compare to one another, and how they may
compare to other measures, in different units.

Ranks are one way of having an implicit comparison between values.[^ordering]
Is the value large in terms of the other values (with high rank) — or is it
small (low rank)?

[^ordering]: To get ranks we have to be able to sort our values in some
    reasonable way from low to high.  This usually makes sense for measured
    data, where the measurement gives a number in the same unit for each
    observation, but may not make sense for other data, such as names or
    labels.  For example, it may or may not be meaningful to rank names
    alphabetically.  As usual, this is a matter of judgment.

We can convert ranks to quantile positions.  Quantile positions are values from
0 through 1 that are closer to 1 for high rank values, and closer to 0 for low
rank values.  The smallest value (and the value with the lowest rank) will have
quantile position 0, the largest value (highest rank) will have quantile
position 1. Each value in the data has a rank, and a corresponding quantile
position.  We can also look at the *value* corresponding to each quantile
position, and these are the *quantile values*, usually called simply
— *quantiles*. You will see what we mean later in the chapter.

Ranks and quantile positions give an idea whether the measure is high or low
compared to the other values, but they do not immediately tell us whether the
measure is exceptional or unusual.  To do that, we may want to ask whether the
measure falls outside the typical range of values — that is, how the measure
compares to the *distribution* of values.  One common way of doing this is to
re-express the measures (values) as *standard scores*, where the standard score
for a particular value tells you how far the value is from the *center* of the
distribution, in terms of the typical *spread* of the distribution. (We will
say more about what we mean by "typical" later.)  Standard values are
particularly useful to allow us to *compare* different types of measures on
a standard scale.  They translate the units of measurement into *standard* and
comparable units.

## Household income and congressional districts

Democratic [congresswoman Marcy
Kaptur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcy_Kaptur) has represented the 9th
district of Ohio since 1983. Ohio's 9th district is relatively working class,
and the Democratic party has, traditionally, represented people with lower
income.  However, Kaptur has pointed out that this pattern appears to be
changing; more of the high-income congressional districts now lean Democrat,
and the Republican party is now more likely to represent lower-income
districts.  The French economist [Thomas
Piketty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Piketty) has described this
phenomenon across several Western countries.  Voters for left parties are now
more likely to be highly educated and wealthy.  He terms this shift "Brahmin
Left Vs Merchant Right" [@piketty2018brahmin].  The data below come from
a [table Kaptur
prepared](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23726766/rep-kaptur-district-chart.pdf)
that shows this pattern in the 2023 US congress. The table lists the top 20
districts by the median income of the households in that district, along with
their representatives and their party.[^median]

[^median]: For now, let us define the median value $M$ as the value such that
    (as close as possible to) half of the households in the district have
    a lower income than $M$, and (as close as possible to) half have a higher
    income.  We will give more detail on the median later in the chapter.

```{python echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
district_income = pd.read_csv('data/congress_2023.csv')
```

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
d_inc <- py$district_income
colnames(d_inc)[which(names(d_inc) == "Median_Income")] <- "Median Income"
ketable(tail(d_inc, 20),
        caption = "20 most wealthy 2023 Congressional districts by household income {#tbl-district_income}")
```

You may notice right away that many of the 20 richest districts have Democratic
Party representatives.

```{python echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
means = district_income.groupby('Party')[['Median_Income']].mean()
demo, repub = means['Median_Income']
pct_diff = (demo - repub) / repub * 100
```

In fact, if we look at all 441 congressional districts in Kaptur's table, we
find a large difference in the average median household income for Democrat and
Republican districts; the Democrat districts are, on average, about
`r round(py$pct_diff)`% richer (@tbl-party_means).

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
means <- py$means
means$Median_Income <- formattable::currency(means$Median_Income, digits = 0)
names(means) <- "Mean of median household income"
ketable(means,
        caption = "Means for median household income by party {#tbl-party_means}")
```

Next we are going to tip our hand, and show how we got these data.  In previous
chapters, we had {{< var cell >}}s like this in which we enter the values we
will analyze.  These values come from the example we introduced in
@sec-public-liquor:

```{python}
# Liquor prices for US states with private market.
priv = np.array([
    4.82, 5.29, 4.89, 4.95, 4.55, 4.90, 5.25, 5.30, 4.29, 4.85, 4.54, 4.75,
    4.85, 4.85, 4.50, 4.75, 4.79, 4.85, 4.79, 4.95, 4.95, 4.75, 5.20, 5.10,
    4.80, 4.29])
```

```{r}
# Liquor prices for US states with private market.
priv <- c(4.82, 5.29, 4.89, 4.95, 4.55, 4.90, 5.25, 5.30, 4.29, 4.85, 4.54,
          4.75, 4.85, 4.85, 4.50, 4.75, 4.79, 4.85, 4.79, 4.95, 4.95, 4.75,
          5.20, 5.10, 4.80, 4.29)
```

Now we have 441 values to enter, and it is time to introduce {{< var lang >}}'s
standard tools for loading data.

### Comma-separated-values (CSV) format {#sec-csv-format}

The data we will load is in a file on disk called `data/congress_2023.csv`.
These are data from Kaptur's table in a comma-separated-values (CSV) format
file. We refer to this file with its *filename*, that starts with the directory
(folder) containing the file — `data/` — followed by the name of the file
(`congress_2023.csv`), giving a filename of `data/congress_2023.csv`.

The *CSV format* is a very simple text format for storing table data.
Usually, the first line of the CSV file contains the column names of the
table, and the rest of the lines contain the row values.  As the name
suggests, commas (`,`) separate the column names in the first line, and the
row values in the following lines. If you opened the `data/congress_2023.csv`
file in some editor, such as Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on Mac, you would
find that the first few lines looked like this:

```{python echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, results="asis"}
from pathlib import Path
backticks = '```'
lines = '\n'.join(
    Path('data/congress_2023.csv').read_text().splitlines()[:6])
# Reticulate seems to suffer with the literal backticks here.
print(f"""{backticks}
{lines}
{backticks}
""")
```

In the code that follows, we will *read* the values from the CSV file directly into {{< var lang >}}.

## Download links with data files

Up till now, the Download links for notebook files point to a single file — the *notebook*.  The
[Jupyter notebook file has extension `.ipynb`]{.python}
[RStudio notebook file has extension `.Rmd`]{.r}.

From now on, some examples involve reading a data file.  In order to run the
notebook, you need the notebook file
(with extension[`.ipynb`]{.python}[`.Rmd`]{.r})
as well as the data file.  For those cases, the download link points to
a `.zip` file containing the notebook file and the data file.  To run the
example on your computer, download the `.zip` file, extract the contents, and
then open the notebook file using {{< var nb_app >}}.

### Introducing the Pandas library {#sec-pandas-intro}

::: {.notebook name="starting_pandas" title="Starting with Pandas"}

Here we use the Pandas library to load table data into Python.

Thus far we have used the Numpy library to work with data in arrays. As always
with Python, when we want to use a library — like Numpy, or Pandas — we have to
`import` it first.

We have used the term *library* here, but Python uses the term *module* to
refer to libraries of code and data that you `import`.  We will use the terms
"library" and "module" to mean the same thing — a Python module.

When using Numpy, we write:

```{python}
# Import the Numpy library (module), name it "np".
import numpy as np
```

Now we will use the Pandas library (module).

We can import Pandas like this:

```{python}
# Import the Pandas library (module)
import pandas
```

As Numpy has a standard abbreviation `np`, that almost everyone writing Python
code will recognize and use, so Pandas has the standard abbreviation `pd`:

```{python}
# Import the Pandas library (module), name it "pd".
import pandas as pd
```

Pandas is the standard data science library for Python.   It is particularly
good at loading data files, and presenting them to us as a useful table-like
structure, called a *data frame*.

We start by using Pandas to load our data file:

```{python}
district_income = pd.read_csv('data/congress_2023.csv')
```

We have thus far done many operations that returned Numpy *arrays*.
`pd.read_csv` returns a Pandas *data frame*:

```{python}
type(district_income)
```

A data frame is Pandas' own way of representing a table, with columns and rows.
You can think of it as Python's version of a spreadsheet.  As strings or Numpy
arrays have *methods* (functions attached to the array), so Pandas data
frames have methods.  These methods do things with the data frame to which they
are attached.  For example, the `head` method of the data frame gives us (by
default) the first five rows in the table:

```{python}
# Show the first five rows in the data frame
district_income.head()
```

The data are in income order, from lowest to highest, so the first five
districts are those with the lowest household income.

We are particularly interested in the column named `Median_Income`.

You may remember the idea of *indexing*, introduced in @sec-array-indexing.
Indexing occurs when we fetch data from within a container, such as a string or
an array.  We do this by putting square brackets `[]` after the value we want
to index into, and put something inside the brackets to say what we want.

For example, to get the *first* element of the `priv` array above, we use
indexing:

```{python}
# Fetch the first element of the priv array with indexing.
# This is the element at position 0.
priv[0]
```

As you can index into strings and Numpy arrays, by using square brackets, so
you can index into Pandas data frames.  Instead of putting the *position*
between the square brackets, we can put the *column name*.  This fetches the
data from that column, returning a new type of value called a Pandas *Series*.

```{python}
# Index into Pandas data frame to get one column of data.
# Notice we use a string between the square brackets, giving the column name.
income_col = district_income['Median_Income']
# The value that comes back is of type Series.  A Series represents the
# data from a single column.
type(income_col)
```

We want to go straight to our familiar Numpy arrays, so we convert the column
of data into a Numpy array, using the `np.array` function you have already
seen:

<!---
Need to introduce indexing with slices.
-->

```{python}
# Convert column data into a Numpy array.
incomes = np.array(income_col)
# Show the first five values, by indexing with a slice.
incomes[:5]
```

<!---
End of notebook.

End of python block

::: r

### Introducing R data frames

::: {.notebook name="intro_data_frames" title="Introducing data frames"}

R is a data analysis language, so, as you would expect, it is particularly good
at loading data files, and presenting them to us as a useful table-like
structure, called a *data frame*.

We start by using R to load our data file.  R has a special function to do
this, called `read.csv`.

```{r}
district_income <- read.csv('data/congress_2023.csv')
```

We have thus far done many operations that returned R *vectors*. `read.csv`
returns a new type of value, called a *data frame*:

```{r}
class(district_income)
```

A data frame is R's own way of representing a table, with columns and rows. You
can think of it as R's version of a spreadsheet.   Data frames are a
fundamental type in R, and there are many functions that operate on them. Among
them is the function `head` which selects (by default) the first six rows of
whatever you send it.  Here we select the first six rows of the data frame.

```{r}
# Show the first six rows in the data frame
head(district_income)
```

The data are in income order, sorted lowest to highest, so the first five
districts are those with the lowest household income.

We are particularly interested in the column named `Median_Income`.

You can fetch columns of data from a data frame by using R's `$` syntax.  The
`$` syntax means "fetch the thing named on the right of the `$` attached to the
value given to the left of the `$`".

So, to get the data for the `Median_Income` column, we can write:

```{r}
# Use $ syntax to get a column of data from a data frame.
# "fetch the Median_Income thing from district_income".
incomes = district_income$Median_Income
# The thing that comes back is our familiar R vector.
# Show the first five values, by indexing with a slice.
incomes[1:5]
```

:::
<!---
End of notebook.
-->

:::
<!---
End of R block
-->

### Incomes and Ranks

We now have the `incomes` values as {{< var an_array >}}.

There are 441 values in the whole vector, one of each congressional
district:

```{python}
len(incomes)
```

```{r}
length(incomes)
```

While we are at it, let us also get the values from the `Ascending_Rank`
column, with the same procedure.  These are ranks from low to high, meaning
1 is the lowest median income, and 441 is the highest median income.

```{python}
lo_to_hi_ranks = np.array(district_income['Ascending_Rank'])
# Show the first five values, by indexing with a slice.
lo_to_hi_ranks[:5]
```

```{r}
lo_to_hi_ranks <- district_income$Ascending_Rank
# Show the first five values, by indexing with a slice.
lo_to_hi_ranks[1:5]
```

In our case, the [data frame]{.r}[DataFrame]{.python} has the `Ascending_Rank`
column with the ranks we need, but if we need the ranks and we don't have them,
we can calculate them using the [`rank` function]{.r}[`rankdata` function from
the Scipy `stats` package]{.python}.

::: python

### Introducing Scipy

Earlier in this chapter we introduced the Pandas module.  We used Pandas to
load the CSV data into Python.

Now we introduce another fundamental Python library for working with data
called Scipy.  The name Scipy comes from the compression of SCIentific PYthon,
and the library is nearly as broad as the name suggests — it is a huge
collection of functions and data that implement a wide range of scientific
algorithms.  Scipy is an umbrella package, in that it contains sub-packages,
each covering a particular field of scientific computing.  One of those
sub-packages is called `stats`, and, yes, it covers statistics.

We can get the Scipy `stats` sub-package with:

```{python}
import scipy.stats
```

but, as for Numpy and Pandas, we often `import` the package with an
abbreviation, such as:

```{python}
# Import the scipy.stats package with the name "sps".
import scipy.stats as sps
```

One of the many functions in `scipy.stats` is the `rankdata` function.

:::

### Calculating ranks

As you might expect, [`rank`]{.r}[`sps.rankdata`]{.python} accepts {{< var
an_array >}} as an input argument.  Let's say that there are
[`n <- length(data)`]{.r}[`n = len(data)`]{.python}
values in the {{< var array >}} that we pass to
[`rank`]{.r}[`sps.rankdata`]{.python}.  The function returns
{{< var an_array >}}, length $n$, where the elements are the ranks of each
corresponding element in the input `data` {{< var array >}}.  A rank value of
1 corresponds the lowest value in `data` (closest to negative infinity), and
a rank of $n$ corresponds to the highest value (closest to positive infinity).

Here's an example `data` {{< var array >}} to show how
[`rank`]{.r}[`sps.rankdata`]{.python} works.

```{python}
# The data.
data = np.array([3, -1, 5, -2])
# Corresponding ranks for the data.
sps.rankdata(data)
```

```{r}
# The data.
data <- c(3, -1, 5, -2)
# Corresponding ranks for the data.
rank(data)
```

We can use [`rank`]{.r}[`sps.rankdata`]{.python} to recalculate the ranks for the
congressional median household income values.

```{python}
# Recalculate the ranks.
recalculated_ranks = sps.rankdata(incomes)
# Show the first 5 ranks.
recalculated_ranks[:5]
```

```{r}
# Recalculate the ranks.
recalculated_ranks <- rank(incomes)
# Show the first 5 ranks.
recalculated_ranks[1:5]
```

## Comparing two values in the district income data

Let us say that we have taken an interest in two particular members of
Congress: the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Republican [Kevin
McCarthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McCarthy), and the progressive
activist and Democrat
[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez).
We will refer to both using their initials: KM for Kevin Owen McCarthy and AOC
for Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez.

By scrolling through the CSV file, or (in our case) using some simple
[R]{.r}[Pandas]{.python} code that we won't cover now, we find the rows
corresponding to McCarthy (KM) and Ocasio-Cortez (AOC)
— @tbl-rows-of-interest.

```{python echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
roi = district_income[district_income['Representative']
                      .isin(['K. McCarthy', 'A. Ocasio-Cortez'])]
```

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
roi <- py$roi
colnames(roi)[which(names(roi) == "Median_Income")] <- "Median Income"
rownames(roi) <- NULL
ketable(roi,
        caption = "Rows for Kevin McCarthy and Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez
        {#tbl-rows-of-interest}")
```

The rows show the *rank* of each congressional district in terms of median
household income.  The districts are ordered by this rank, so we can get their
respective *indices* (positions) in the `incomes` {{< var array >}} from their
rank.
[Remember, Python's indices start at 0, whereas the ranks start at 1, so we
need to subtract 1 from the rank to get the index]{.python}

```{python}
# Rank of McCarthy's district in terms of median household income.
km_rank = 295
# Index (position) of McCarthy's value in the "incomes" array.
# Subtract one from rank, because Python starts indices at 0 rather than 1.
km_index = km_rank - 1
```

```{r}
# Rank of McCarthy's district in terms of median household income.
km_rank = 295
# Index (position) of McCarthy's value in the "incomes" vector.
# This is the same as the rank.
km_index = km_rank
```

Now we have the index (position) of KM's value, we can find the household
income for his district from the `incomes` {{< var array >}}:

```{python}
# Show the median household income from McCarthy's district
# by indexing into the "incomes" array:
km_income = incomes[km_index]
km_income
```

```{r}
# Show the median household income from McCarthy's district
# by indexing into the "incomes" vector:
km_income <- incomes[km_index]
km_income
```

Here is the corresponding index and `incomes` value for AOC:

```{python}
# Index (position) of AOC's value in the "incomes" array.
aoc_rank = 81
aoc_index = aoc_rank - 1
# Show the median household income from AOC's district
# by indexing into the "incomes" array:
aoc_income = incomes[aoc_index]
aoc_income
```

```{r}
# Index (position) of AOC's value in the "incomes" array.
aoc_rank = 81
aoc_index = aoc_rank
# Show the median household income from AOC's district
# by indexing into the "incomes" array:
aoc_income <- incomes[aoc_index]
aoc_income
```

Notice that we fetch the same value for median household income from `incomes`
as you see in the corresponding rows.

## Comparing values with ranks and quantile positions

We have KM's and AOC's district median household income values, but our next
question might be — how unusual are these values?

Of course, it depends what we mean by *unusual*.   We might mean, are they
greater or smaller than most of the other values?

One way of answering that question is simply looking at the rank of the values.
If the rank is lower than $\frac{441}{2} = 220.5$ then this is a district with
lower income than most districts.  If it is greater than $220.5$ then it has
higher income than most districts.  We see that KM's district, with rank `r
get_var('km_rank')`, is wealthier than most, whereas AOC's district (rank `r
get_var('aoc_rank')`) is poorer than most.

But we can't interpret the ranks without remembering that there are 441 values,
so — for example - a rank of 81 represents a relatively low value, whereas one
of 295 is relatively high.

We would like some scale that tells us immediately whether this is a relatively
low or a relatively high value, without having to remembering how many values
there are.

This is a good use for *quantile positions* (QPs).  The QP of a value tells you
where the value ranks relative to the other values, on a scale from $0$ through
$1$. A QP of $0$ tells you this is the lowest-ranking value, and a QP of $1$
tells you this is the highest-ranking value.

We can calculate the QP for each rank.  Think of the low-to-high ranks as being
a line starting at 1 (the lowest rank — for the lowest median income) and going
up to 441 (the highest rank — for the highest median income).

The QP corresponding to any particular rank tells you how far along this line
the rank is.  Notice that the length of the line is the distance from the first
to the last value, so 441 - 1 = 440.

So, if the rank was $1$, then the value is at the start of the line.  It has
got $\frac{0}{440}$ of the way along the line, and the QP is $0$. If the rank is
$441$, the value is at the end of the line, it has got $\frac{440}{440}$ of the
way along the line and the QP is $1$.

Now consider the rank of $100$.  It has got $\frac{(100 - 1)}{440}$ of the way
along the line, and the QP position is `r round(99 / 440, 2)`.

More generally, we can translate the high-to-low ranks to QPs with:

```{python}
# Length of the line defining quantile positions.
# Start of line is rank 1 (quantile position 0).
# End of line is rank 441 (quantile position 1).
distance = len(lo_to_hi_ranks) - 1  # 440 in our case.
# What proportion along the line does each value get to?
quantile_positions = (lo_to_hi_ranks - 1) / distance
# Show the first five.
quantile_positions[:5]
```

```{r}
# Length of the line defining quantile positions.
# Start of line is rank 1 (quantile position 0).
# End of line is rank 441 (quantile position 1).
distance <- length(lo_to_hi_ranks) - 1  # 440 in our case.
quantile_positions <- (lo_to_hi_ranks - 1) / distance
# Show the first five.
quantile_positions[1:5]
```

Let's plot the ranks and the QPs together on the x-axis:


```{python echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
lo_to_hi_ranks = get_var('lo_to_hi_ranks')
incomes = get_var('incomes')
L = len(lo_to_hi_ranks)

def rank2qp(r):
    return (r - 1) / (L - 1)

def qp2rank(qp):
    return qp * (L - 1) + 1

# Plot blue crosses at data points.
def plot_ranks_qps():
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.plot(lo_to_hi_ranks, incomes,
            color='blue', marker='+',
            linestyle=':')
    ax.set_title('Ranked median household incomes for congressional districts')
    ax.set_xlabel('Rank')
    ax.set_xticks([1, 100, 200, 300, 400, 441])
    ax.set_ylabel('Median household income')

    secax = ax.secondary_xaxis('top', functions=(rank2qp, qp2rank))
    secax.set_xlabel('Quantile position')
    return ax, secax

plot_ranks_qps();
```

The QPs for KM and AOC tell us where their districts' incomes are in the
ranks, on a 0 to 1 scale:

```{python}
km_quantile_position = quantile_positions[km_index]
km_quantile_position
```

```{r}
km_quantile_position <- quantile_positions[km_index]
km_quantile_position
```

```{python}
aoc_quantile_position = quantile_positions[aoc_index]
aoc_quantile_position
```

```{r}
aoc_quantile_position <- quantile_positions[aoc_index]
aoc_quantile_position
```

If we multiply the QP by 100, we get the *percentile positions* — so the
percentile position ranges from 0 through 100.

```{python}
# Percentile positions are just quantile positions * 100
print('KM percentile position:', km_quantile_position * 100)
print('AOC percentile position:', aoc_quantile_position * 100)
```

```{r}
# Percentile positions are just quantile positions * 100
message('KM percentile position: ', km_quantile_position * 100)
message('AOC percentile position: ', aoc_quantile_position * 100)
```

Now consider one particular QP: $0.5$.  The $0.5$ QP is exactly half-way along
the line from rank $1$ to rank $441$.  In our case this corresponds to rank
$\frac{441 - 1}{2} + 1 = 221$.

```{python}
# For rank 221 we need index 220, because Python indices start at 0
print('Middle rank:', lo_to_hi_ranks[220])
print('Quantile position:', quantile_positions[220])
```

```{r}
message('Middle rank: ', lo_to_hi_ranks[221])
message('Quantile position: ', quantile_positions[221])
```

The *value* corresponding to any particular QP is the *quantile value*, or just
the *quantile* for short.  For a QP of 0.5, the *quantile* (quantile value) is:

```{python}
# Quantile value for 0.5
print('Quantile value for QP of 0.5:', incomes[220])
```

```{r}
# Quantile value for 0.5
message('Quantile value for QP of 0.5: ', incomes[221])
```

In fact we can ask {{< var lang >}} for this *value* (quantile) directly, using
the `quantile` function:

```{python}
np.quantile(incomes, 0.5)
```

```{r}
quantile(incomes, 0.5)
```

:::{.callout-note}
## `quantile` and sorting

In our case, the `incomes` data is already sorted from lowest (at position
[1]{.r}[0]{.python} in the {{< var array >}} to highest (at position
[441]{.r}[440]{.python} in the {{< var array >}}).  The `quantile` function
does not need the data to be sorted; it does its own internal sorting to do the
calculation.

For example, we could shuffle `incomes` into a random order, and still get the
same values from `quantile`.

```{python}
rnd = np.random.default_rng()
shuffled_incomes = rnd.permuted(incomes)
# Quantile still gives the same value.
np.quantile(incomes, 0.5)
```

```{r}
shuffled_incomes <- sample(incomes)
# Quantile still gives the same value.
quantile(incomes, 0.5)
```

:::

Above we have the 0.5 *quantile* — the value corresponding to the QP of 0.5.

The 0.5 quantile is an interesting value.  By the definition of QP, exactly
half of the remaining values (after excluding the 0.5 quantile value) have
lower rank, and are therefore less   than the 0.5 quantile value. Similarly
exactly half of the remaining values are greater than the 0.5 quantile.   You
may recognize this as the *median* value.  This is such a common quantile value
that {{< var np_or_r >}} has a function [`median`]{.r}[`np.median`]{.python} as
a shortcut for [`quantile(data, 0.5)`]{.r}[`np.quantile(data, 0.5)`]{.python}.

```{python}
np.median(incomes)
```

Another interesting QP is 0.25.  We find the QP of 0.25 at rank:

```{python}
qp25_rank = (441 - 1) * 0.25 + 1
qp25_rank
```

```{r}
qp25_rank <- (441 - 1) * 0.25 + 1
qp25_rank
```

```{python}
# Therefore, index 110 (Python indices start from 0)
print('Rank corresponding to QP 0.25:', qp25_rank)
print('0.25 quantile value:', incomes[110])
print('0.25 quantile value using np.quantile:',
      np.quantile(incomes, 0.25))
```

```{r}
message('Rank corresponding to QP 0.25: ', qp25_rank)
message('0.25 quantile value: ', incomes[qp25_rank])
message('0.25 quantile value using quantile: ', quantile(incomes, 0.25))
```

```{python echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
incomes = get_var('incomes')

ax, secax = plot_ranks_qps()
qp25 = 111
q25 = np.quantile(incomes, 0.25)
x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max = ax.axis()
ax.axvline(qp25, linestyle=':', color='k')
ax.plot([qp25, x_min], [q25, q25], 'k:', label='0.25 quantile')
ax.legend()
```

Call the 0.25 quantile value $V$.  $V$ is the number such that 25% of the
*remaining* values are less than $V$, and 75% are greater.

Now let's think about the 0.01 quantile.  We don't have an *income value*
exactly corresponding to this QP, because there is no rank exactly
corresponding to the 0.01 QP.

```{python}
rank_for_qp001 = (441 - 1) * 0.01 + 1
rank_for_qp001
```

```{r}
rank_for_qp001 <- (441 - 1) * 0.01 + 1
rank_for_qp001
```

Let's have a look at the first 10 values for rank / QP and incomes:

```{python echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
def plot_ranks_qps_001():
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.plot(lo_to_hi_ranks[:10], incomes[:10],
            color='blue', marker='+',
            linestyle=':')
    ax.set_title('Ranked median household incomes for congressional districts')
    ax.set_xlabel('Rank')
    ax.set_xticks([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10])
    ax.set_ylabel('Median household income')
    secax = ax.secondary_xaxis('top', functions=(rank2qp, qp2rank))
    secax.set_xlabel('Gradient position')
    secax.set_xticks(np.linspace(0, 0.02, 5));
    return ax, secax

plot_ranks_qps_001();
```

What then, is the quantile value for QP = 0.01?  There are various ways to
answer that question [@hyndman1996sample], but one obvious way, and the default
for {{< var np_or_r >}}, is to draw a straight line up from the matching rank
— or equivalently, down from the QP — then note where that line crosses the
lines joining the values to the left and right of the QP on the graph above,
and look across to the y-axis for the corresponding value:

```{python echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
rank_for_qp001 = get_var('rank_for_qp001')

ax, secax = plot_ranks_qps_001()

q001 = np.quantile(incomes, 0.01)
ax.axvline(rank_for_qp001, linestyle=':', color='k')
ax.plot([rank_for_qp001, 0], [q001, q001], 'k:', label='0.01 quantile')
ax.legend();
```

```{python}
np.quantile(incomes, 0.01)
```

```{r}
quantile(incomes, 0.01)
```

This is called the *linear* method — because it uses straight lines joining the
points to estimate the quantile value for a QP that does not correspond to
a whole-number rank.

:::{.callout-note}
## Calculating quantiles using the linear method

We gave a graphical explanation of how to calculate the quantile for a QP
that does not correspond to whole-number rank in the data.  A more formal way
of getting the value using the numerical equivalent of the graphical method is
[linear interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation).
Linear interpolation calculates the quantile value as a *weighted average* of
the quantile values for the QPs of the whole number ranks just less than, and
just greater than the QP we are interested in. For example, let us return to
the QP of $0.01$.  Here are the QPs, whole-number ranks and corresponding
values either side of the QP $0.01$:

| Rank | Quantile position | Quantile value |
|------|-------------------|----------------|
| 5    | 0.0099            | 37933          |
| 5.4  | 0.01              | **V**          |
| 6    | 0.0113            | 40319          |

: Ranks, QPs and corresponding values around QP of 0.01

What value should we should give $V$ in the table?  One answer is to take the
average of the two values either side of the desired QP — in this case $(37933
+ 40319) / 2$.  We could write this same calculation as $37933 * 0.5
+ 40319 * 0.5$ — showing that we are giving equal weight ($0.5$) to the two
values either side.

But giving both values equal weight doesn't seem quite right, because the QP we
want is closer to the QP for rank 5 (and corresponding value 37933) than it is
to the QP for rank 6 (and corresponding value 40319).  We should give more
weight to the rank 5 value than the rank 6 value.   Specifically the lower
value is 0.4 rank units away from the QP rank we want, and the higher is 0.6
rank units away.  So we give higher weight for shorter distance, and multiply
the rank 5 value by $1 - 0.4 = 0.6$, and the rank 6 value by $1 - 0.6 = 0.4$.
Therefore the weighted average is $37933 * 0.6 + 40319 * 0.4 = 38887.4$. This
is a mathematical way to get the value we described graphically, of tracking up
from the rank of 5.4 to the line drawn between the values for rank 5 and 6, and
reading off the y-value at which this track crosses that line.
:::


## Unusual values compared to the distribution

Now we return the problem of whether KMs and AOCs districts are unusual in
terms of their median household incomes.  From what we have so far, we might
conclude that AOC's district is fairly poor, and KM's district is relatively
wealthy.  But — are either of their districts *unusual* in their wealth or
poverty?

To answer that question, we have to think about the *distribution* of values.
Are either AOC's or KM's district outside the *typical spread* of values for
districts?

The rest of this section is an attempt to answer what we could mean by
*outside* and *typical spread*.

Let us start with a histogram of the district incomes, marking the position of
the KM and AOC districts.

```{python echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
km_income = get_var('km_income')
aoc_income = get_var('aoc_income')
# Use 25 bins for the histogram.
plt.hist(incomes, bins=25, color='gray');
plt.title('Median household income for 2023 congressional districts');
plt.axvline(km_income, color='red', linestyle=':', label='KM')
plt.axvline(aoc_income, color='blue', linestyle=':', label='AOC')
plt.legend();
```

What could we mean by "outside" the "typical spread".  By outside, we mean
somewhere away from the center of the distribution.  Let us take the mean of
the distribution to be its center, and add that to the plot.

```{python}
mean_income = np.mean(incomes)
```

```{r}
mean_income <- mean(incomes)
```

```{python echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
mean_income = get_var('mean_income')
plt.hist(incomes, bins=25, color='gray');
plt.title('Median household income for 2023 congressional districts');
plt.axvline(km_income, color='red', linestyle=':', label='KM')
plt.axvline(aoc_income, color='blue', linestyle=':', label='KM')
plt.axvline(mean_income, color='green', linestyle='-', label='Mean')
plt.legend();
```

## On deviations

Now let us ask what we could mean by *typical spread*.  By *spread* we mean
deviation either side of the center.

We can calculate how far away each income is away from the mean, by subtracting
the mean from all the income values.  Call the result — the *deviations* from
the mean, or *deviations* for short.

```{python}
deviations = incomes - np.mean(incomes)
```

```{r}
deviations <- incomes - mean(incomes)
```

The deviation values give, for each district, how far that district's income is
from the mean.  Values near the mean will have small (positive or negative)
values, and values further from the mean will have large (positive and
negative) values.  Here is a histogram of the *deviation* values.

```{python echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
deviations = get_var('deviations')
plt.hist(deviations, bins=25, color='gray');
plt.title('Deviations of median household income for 2023 congressional districts');
```

Notice that the shape of the distribution has not changed — all that changed is
the position of the distribution on the x-axis.  In fact, the distribution of
deviations centers on zero — the deviations have a mean of (as near as the
computer can accurately calculate) zero:

```{python}
# Show the mean of the deviations, rounded to 8 decimal places.
np.round(np.mean(deviations), 8)
```

```{r}
# Show the mean of the deviations, rounded to 8 decimal places.
round(mean(deviations), 8)
```

## The mean absolute deviation

Now let us consider the deviation value for KM and AOC:

```{python}
print('Deviation for KM:', deviations[km_index])
print('Deviation for AOC:', deviations[aoc_index])
```

```{r}
message('Deviation for KM: ', deviations[km_index])
message('Deviation for AOC: ', deviations[aoc_index])
```

We have the same problem as before.  Yes, we see that KM has a positive
deviation, and therefore, that his district is more wealthy than average across
the 441 districts.  Conversely AOC's district has a negative deviation, and is
poorer than average.  But we still lack a standard measure of how far away from
the mean each district is, in terms of the spread of values in the histogram.

To get such a standard measure, we would like idea of a typical or average
deviation.  Then we will compare KM's and AOC's deviations to the average
deviation, to see if they are unusually far from the mean.

You have just seen above that we cannot use the literal average (mean) of the
deviations for this purpose because the positive and negative deviations will
exactly cancel out, and the mean deviation will always be as near as the
computer can calculate to zero.

To stop the negatives canceling the positives, we can simply knock the minus
signs off all the negative deviations.

This is the job of the {{< var np_or_r >}} `abs` function — where `abs` is
short for *absolute*.

:::{#nte-abs-function .callout-note}
## The [`np.abs`]{.python}[`abs`]{.r} function

The [`np.abs`]{.python}[`abs`]{.r} function will knock minus signs off negative
values, like this:

```{python}
np.abs(-3.1)
```

```{r}
abs(-3.1)
```

```{python}
np.abs([-1, 0, 1, -2])
```

```{r}
abs(c(-1, 0, 1, -2))
```

:::

To get an average of the deviations, *regardless of whether they are positive
or negative*, we can take the mean of the absolute deviations, like this:

```{python}
# The Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)
abs_deviations = np.abs(deviations)
mad = np.mean(abs_deviations)
# Show the result
mad
```

```{r}
# The Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)
abs_deviations <- abs(deviations)
mad <- mean(abs_deviations)
# Show the result
mad
```

This is the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD).  It is one measure of the typical
spread.  MAD is the average distance (regardless of positive or negative) of
a value from the mean of the values.

We can get an idea of how typical a particular deviation is by dividing the
deviation by the MAD value, like this:

```{python}
print('Deviation in MAD units for KM:', deviations[km_index] / mad)
print('Deviation in MAD units AOC:', deviations[aoc_index] / mad)
```

```{r}
message('Deviation in MAD units for KM: ', deviations[km_index] / mad)
message('Deviation in MAD units AOC: ', deviations[aoc_index] / mad)
```

## The standard deviation {#sec-standard-deviation}

We are interested in the average deviation, but we find that a simple average
of the deviations from the mean always gives 0 (perhaps with some tiny
calculation error), because the positive and negative deviations cancel
exactly.

The MAD calculation solves this problem by knocking the signs off the negative
values before we take the mean.

### Squares of values and {{< var array >}}s {#sec-squared-arrays}

Another very popular way of solving the same problem is to precede the
calculation by squaring all the deviations.  {{< var lang >}} has an operator for the operation of taking values to the power of another value: it is `**`.  For example, to square a single number, we take the number *to the power of* 2, like this:

```{python}
# 10 to the power of 2.
10 ** 2
```

```{r}
# 10 to the power of 2.
10 ** 2
```

You can also use the power of `**` operator on {{< var an_array >}}, and, as
usual, that works *elementwise*.  The array you get back is the result of
applying the to-the-power-of operation to all elements of the {{< var array >}}
in turn:

```{python}
an_arr = np.array([2, 10, 12])
# All the elements in the array, to the power of 2.
an_arr ** 2
```

```{r}
a_vector = c(2, 10, 12)
# All the elements in the vector, to the power of 2.
a_vector ** 2
```

### Calculating the standard deviation

We can therefore square the deviations we calculated above, like this:

```{python}
squared_deviations = deviations ** 2
# Show the first five values.
squared_deviations[:5]
```

```{r}
squared_deviations <- deviations ** 2
# Show the first five values.
squared_deviations[1:5]
```

:::{.callout-note}
## Exponential format for showing very large and very small numbers

The `squared_deviation` values above appear in *exponential notation*
(E-notation).  Other terms for E-notation are [scientific
notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation), *scientific
form*, or *standard form*. E-notation is a useful way to express very large
(far from 0) or very small (close to 0) numbers in a more compact form.

E-notation represents a value as a floating point value $m$ multiplied by 10 to
the power of an exponent $n$:

$$
m * 10^n
$$

$m$ is a floating point number with one digit before the decimal point — so it
can be any value from 1.0 through 9.9999... $n$ is an integer (positive or
negative whole number).

For example, the median household income of KM's district is 77205 (dollars).
We can express that same number in E-notation as $7.7205 * 10^4$ .
{{< var lang >}} writes this as `7.7205e4`, where the number before the `e` is
$m$ and the number after the `e` is the exponent value $n$. E-notation is
another way of writing the number, because $7.7205 * 10^4 = 77205$.

```{python}
7.7205e4 == 77205
```

```{r}
7.7205e4 == 77205
```

It is no great advantage to use E-notation in this case; 77205 is probably
easier to read and understand than `7.7205e4`.  The notation comes into its
own where you start to lose track of the powers of 10 when you read a number
— and that does happen when the number becomes very long without E-notation.
For example, $77205^2 = 5960612025$.  $5960612025$ is long enough that you
start having to count the digits to see how large it is.  In E-notation, that
number is `5.960612025e9`.  If you remember that $10^9$ is one US billion, then
the E-notation tells you at a glance that the value is about $5.9$ billion.

{{< var lang >}} makes its own decision whether to print out numbers using
E-notation.   This only affects the display of the numbers; the underlying
values remain the same whether {{< var lang >}} chooses to show them in
E-notation or not.

:::

The process of squaring the deviations turns all the negative values into
positive values.

We can then take the average (mean) of the *squared deviations* to give
a measure of the typical *squared* deviation:

```{python}
mean_squared_deviation = np.mean(squared_deviations)
mean_squared_deviation
```

```{r}
mean_squared_deviation <- mean(squared_deviations)
mean_squared_deviation
```

Rather confusingly, the field of statistics uses the term *variance* to refer
to the mean squared deviation value.  Just to emphasize that naming, let's do
the same calculation but using "variance" as the variable name.

```{python}
# Statistics calls the mean squared deviation - the "variance"
variance = np.mean(squared_deviations)
variance
```

```{r}
# Statistics calls the mean squared deviation - the "variance"
variance <- mean(squared_deviations)
variance
```

::: python

It will come as no surprise to find that Numpy has a function to do the whole
variance calculation — subtracting the mean, and returning the average squared
deviation — `np.var`:

```{python}
# Use np.var to calculate the mean squared deviation directly.
np.var(incomes)
```
:::

The variance is the typical (in the sense of the mean) *squared* deviation.
The units for the variance, in our case, would be *squared dollars*.  But we
are more interested in the typical *deviation*, in our original units --
dollars rather than squared dollars.

So we take the square root of the mean squared deviation (the square root of
the variance), to get the *standard deviation*.  It is the *standard* deviation
in that it is a measure of *typical* deviation, in the specific sense of the
square root of the mean squared deviations.

```{python}
# The standard deviation is the square root of the mean squared deviation.
# (and therefore, the square root of the variance).
standard_deviation = np.sqrt(mean_squared_deviation)
standard_deviation
```

```{r}
# The standard deviation is the square root of the mean squared deviation.
# (and therefore, the square root of the variance).
standard_deviation <- sqrt(mean_squared_deviation)
standard_deviation
```

::: python

Again,  Numpy has a function to do this calculation directly: `np.std`:

```{python}
# Use np.std to calculate the square root of the mean squared deviation
# directly.
np.std(incomes)
```

```{python}
# Of course, np.std(incomes) is the same as:
np.sqrt(np.var(incomes))
```
:::

The *standard deviation* (the square root of the mean squared deviation) is
a popular alternative to the Mean Absolute Deviation, as a measure of typical
spread.

@fig-mean-stds shows another histogram of the `income` values, marking the
mean, the mean plus or minus one standard deviation, and the mean plus or minus
two standard deviations.  You can see that the mean plus or minus one standard
deviation includes a fairly large proportion of the data.  The mean plus or
minus two standard deviation includes a much larger proportion.

```{python, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, label=fig-mean-stds, fig.cap='Income histogram plus or minus 1 and 2 standard deviations'}
m = mean_income
s = get_var('standard_deviation')
plt.hist(incomes, bins=25, color='gray')
plt.axvline(m, color='green', linestyle='-', label='Mean')
plt.axvline(m - 2 * s , color='red', linestyle=':', label='Mean minus 2 SDs')
plt.axvline(m - 1 * s , color='orange', linestyle=':', label='Mean minus 1 SD')
plt.axvline(m + 1 * s , color='blue', linestyle=':', label='Mean plus 1 SD')
plt.axvline(m + 2 * s , color='black', linestyle=':', label='Mean plus 2 SDs')
plt.legend()
```

Now let us return to the question of how unusual our two congressional
districts are in terms of the distribution.  First we calculate the number of
standard deviations of each district from the mean:

```{python}
km_std_devs = deviations[km_index] / standard_deviation
print('Deviation in standard deviation units for KM:',
      np.round(km_std_devs, 2))
aoc_std_devs = deviations[aoc_index] / standard_deviation
print('Deviation in standard deviation units for AOC:',
      np.round(aoc_std_devs, 2))
```

```{r}
km_std_devs <- deviations[km_index] / standard_deviation
message('Deviation in standard deviation units for KM: ',
        round(km_std_devs, 2))
aoc_std_devs <- deviations[aoc_index] / standard_deviation
message('Deviation in standard deviation units for AOC: ',
        round(aoc_std_devs, 2))
```

The values for each district are a re-expression of the income values in terms
of the distribution.  They give the distance from the mean (positive or
negative) in units of standard deviation.

## Standard scores

We will often find uses for the procedure we have just applied, where we take
the original values (here, `incomes`) and:

* Subtract the mean to convert to deviations, then
* Divide by the standard deviation

Let's apply that procedure to all the `incomes` values.

First we calculate the standard deviation:

```{python}
deviations = incomes - np.mean(incomes)
income_std = np.sqrt(np.mean(deviations ** 2))
```

```{r}
deviations <- incomes - mean(incomes)
income_std <- sqrt(mean(deviations ** 2))
```

Then we calculate standard scores:

```{python}
deviations_in_stds = deviations / income_std
# Show the first five values.
deviations_in_stds[:5]
```

```{r}
deviations_in_stds <- deviations / income_std
# Show the first five values.
deviations_in_stds[1:5]
```

This procedure converts the original data (here `incomes`) to deviations from
the mean in terms of the standard deviation.  The resulting values are called
[standard scores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score) or *z-scores*.
One name for this procedure is "z-scoring".

If you plot a histogram of the standard scores, you will see they have a mean
of (actually exactly) 0, and a standard deviation of (actually exactly) 1.

```{python, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
deviations_in_stds = get_var('deviations_in_stds')
plt.hist(deviations_in_stds, bins=25, color='gray')
```

With all this information — what should we conclude about the two districts in
question?  KM's district is `r round(get_var('km_std_devs'), 2)` standard
deviations _above_ the mean, but that's not enough to conclude that it is
unusual.  We see from the histogram that a large proportion of the districts
are at least this distance from the mean.  We can calculate that proportion
directly.

```{python}
# Distances (negative or positive) from the mean.
abs_std_devs = np.abs(deviations_in_stds)
# Number where distance greater than KM distance.
n_gt_km = np.sum(abs_std_devs > km_std_devs)
prop_gt_km = n_gt_km / len(deviations_in_stds)
print("Proportion of districts further from mean than KM:",
      np.round(prop_gt_km, 2))
```

```{r}
# Distances (negative or positive) from the mean.
abs_std_devs <- abs(deviations_in_stds)
# Number where distance greater than KM distance.
n_gt_km <- sum(abs_std_devs > km_std_devs)
prop_gt_km <- n_gt_km / length(deviations_in_stds)
message("Proportion of districts further from mean than KM: ",
        round(prop_gt_km, 2))

A full `r round(get_var('prop_gt_km'), 2) * 100`% of districts are further from
the mean than is KM's district.  KM's district is richer than average, but not
unusual.  The benefit of the standard deviation distance is that we can see
this directly from the value, without doing the calculation of proportions,
because the standard deviation is a measure of typical spread, and KM's
district is well-within this measure.

AOC's district is `r round(get_var('aoc_std_devs'), 2)` standard deviations
from the mean.  This is a little more unusual than KM's score.

```{python}
# Number where distance greater than AOC distance.
# Make AOC's distance positive to correspond to distance from the mean.
n_gt_aoc = np.sum(abs_std_devs > np.abs(aoc_std_devs))
prop_gt_aoc = n_gt_aoc / len(deviations_in_stds)
print("Proportion of districts further from mean than AOC:",
      np.round(prop_gt_aoc, 2))
```

```{r}
# Number where distance greater than AOC distance.
# Make AOC's distance positive to correspond to distance from the mean.
n_gt_aoc <- sum(abs_std_devs > abs(aoc_std_devs))
prop_gt_aoc <- n_gt_aoc / length(deviations_in_stds)
message("Proportion of districts further from mean than AOC's district: ",
        round(prop_gt_aoc, 2))
```

Only `r round(get_var('prop_gt_aoc'), 2) * 100`% of districts are further from
the mean than AOC's district, but this is still a reasonable proportion.  We
see from the standard score that AOC is within one standard deviation.   AOC's
district is poorer than average, but not to a remarkable degree.

## Standard scores to compare values on different scales {#sec-standard-scores}

Why are standard scores so useful?  They allow us to compare values on very
different scales.

Consider the values in @tbl-epl-points-wages.  Each row of the table
corresponds to a team competing in the English Premier League (EPL) for the
2021-2022 season.  For those of you with absolutely no interest in sports, the
EPL is the league of the top 20 teams in English football, or *soccer* to our
North American friends.  The `points` column of the table gives the total
number of points at the end of the 2021 season (from 38 games).  The team gets
3 points for a win, and 1 point for a draw, so the maximum possible points from
38 games are $3 * 38 = 114$. The `wages` column gives the estimated total wage
bill in thousands of British Pounds (£1000).

```{python echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
points_wages = pd.read_csv('data/premier_league.csv')
```

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
ketable(py$points_wages,
        caption = "2021 points and wage bills (£1000s) for EPL teams
        {#tbl-epl-points-wages}")
```

Let's say we own [Crystal Palace Football
Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.). Crystal Palace was
a bit below average in the league in terms of points. Now we are thinking about
whether we should invest in higher-paid players for the coming season, to
improve our points score, and therefore, league position.

One thing we might like to know is whether there is an association between the
wage bill and the points scored.

To look at that, we can do a scatter plot.  This is a plot with — say — wages
on the x-axis, and points on the y-axis.  For each team we have a pair of
values — their wage bill and their points scored.  For each team, we put
a marker on the scatter plot at the coordinates given by the wage value (on the
x-axis) and the points value (on the y-axis).

Here is that plot for our EPL data in @tbl-epl-points-wages, with the Crystal
Palace marker picked out in red.

```{python, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
plt.scatter(points_wages['wages'],
            points_wages['points'])
cp = points_wages[points_wages['team'] == 'Crystal Palace'].iloc[0]
plt.plot(cp['wages'], cp['points'], 'ro', label='Crystal Palace')
plt.xlabel('Wage bill in £1000s')
plt.ylabel('Total points scored')
plt.title('Relationship of wages to points scored')
plt.legend(loc='lower right')
```

It looks like there is a rough association of wages and points; teams that
spend more in wages tend to have more points.

At the moment, the points and wages are in very different units.  Points are on
a possible scale of 0 (lose every game) to 38 * 3 = 114 (win every game). Wages
are in thousands of pounds.   Maybe we are not interested in the values in
these units, but in how unusual the values are, in terms of wages, and in terms
of points.

This is a good application of standard scores.   Standard scores convert the
original values to values on a standard scale, where 0 corresponds to an
average value, 1 to a value one standard deviation above the mean, and -1 to
a value one standard deviation below the mean.  If we follow the standard score
process for both points and wages, the values will be in the same standard
units.

To do this calculation, we need the values from the table.  We follow the same
recipe as before, in loading the data with [R]{.r}[Pandas, and converting to
arrays]{.python}.

```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

points_wages = pd.read_csv('data/premier_league.csv')
points = np.array(points_wages['points'])
wages = np.array(points_wages['wages'])
```

```{r}
points_wages = read.csv('data/premier_league.csv')
points = points_wages$points
wages = points_wages$wages
```

As you recall, the standard deviation is the square root of the mean squared
deviation.  In code:

```{python}
# The standard deviation is the square root of the
# mean squared deviation.
wage_deviations = wages - np.mean(wages)
wage_std = np.sqrt(np.mean(wage_deviations ** 2))
wage_std
```

```{r}
# The standard deviation is the square root of the
# mean squared deviation.
wage_deviations <- wages - mean(wages)
wage_std <- sqrt(mean(wage_deviations ** 2))
wage_std
```

Now we can apply the standard score procedure to wages.  We divide the
deviations by the standard deviation.

```{python}
standard_wages = (wages - np.mean(wages)) / wage_std
```

```{r}
standard_wages <- (wages - mean(wages)) / wage_std
```

We apply the same procedure to the points:

```{python}
point_deviations = points - np.mean(points)
point_std = np.sqrt(np.mean(point_deviations ** 2))
standard_points = point_deviations / point_std
```

```{r}
point_deviations <- points - mean(points)
point_std = sqrt(mean(point_deviations ** 2))
standard_points = point_deviations / point_std
```

Now, when we plot the standard score version of the points against the standard
score version of the wages, we see that they are in comparable units, each with
a mean of 0, and a spread (a standard deviation) of 1.

```{python, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
# Get variables into Python for plot (we need this in the R edition).
standard_wages = get_var('standard_wages')
standard_points = get_var('standard_points')
# Make plot.
plt.scatter(standard_wages, standard_points)
plt.xlabel('Wage bill in standard units')
plt.ylabel('Total points scored in standard units')
plt.title('Relationship of wages to points scored in standard scores')
```

Let us go back to our concerns as the owners of Crystal Palace.  Counting down
from the top in the table above, we see that Crystal Palace is the 12th row.
Therefore, we can get the Crystal Palace wage value with:

```{python}
# In Python the 12th value is at position (index) 11
cp_index = 11
cp_wages = wages[cp_index]
cp_wages
```

```{r}
cp_index <- 12
cp_wages <- wages[cp_index]
cp_wages
```

We can get our wage bill in standard units in the same way:

```{python}
cp_standard_wages = standard_wages[cp_index]
cp_standard_wages
```

```{r}
cp_standard_wages <- standard_wages[cp_index]
cp_standard_wages
```

Our wage bill is a below average, but its still within striking distance of the
mean.

We know that we are comparing ourselves against the other teams, so perhaps we
want to increase our wage bill by one standard deviation, to push us above the
mean, and somewhat away from the center of the pack.  If we add one standard
deviation to our wage bill, that increases the standard score of our wages by
1.

But — if we increase our wages by one standard deviation — how much can we
expect that to increase our points — in standard units.

That is question about the strength of the association between two measures
— here wages and points — and we will cover that topic in much more detail in
@sec-correlation-causation.  But, racing ahead — here is the answer to the
question we have just posed — the amount we expect to gain in points, in
standard units, if we increase our wages by one standard deviation (and
therefore, 1 in standard units).

For reasons we won't justify now, we calculate the $r$ value of association
between wages and points, like this:

```{python}
standards_multiplied = standard_wages * standard_points
r = np.mean(standards_multiplied)
r
```

```{r}
standards_multiplied <- standard_wages * standard_points
r = mean(standards_multiplied)
r
```

The $r$ value is the answer to our question.  For every one unit increase in
standard scores in wages, we expect an increase of $r$ (`r get_var('r')`)
standard score units in points.

## Conclusion

When we look at a set of values, we often ask questions about whether
individual values are unusual or surprising.  One way of doing that is to look
at where the values are in the sorted order — for example, using the raw rank
of values, or the proportion of values below this value — the quantile position
or percentile position of a value.  Another measure of interest is where
a value is in comparison to the spread of all values either side of the mean.
We use the term "deviations" to refer to the original values after we have
subtracted the mean of the values.  We can measure spread either side of the
mean with metrics such as the mean of the absolute deviations (MAD) and the
square root of the mean squared deviations (the standard deviation).  One
common use of the deviations and the standard deviation is to transform values
into *standard scores*.  These are the deviations divided by the standard
deviation, and they transform values to have a standard mean (zero) and spread
(standard deviation of 1).  Standard scores make it easier to compare sets of
values with very different ranges and means.
