## Introduction

The central concept for dealing with uncertainty is probability. Hence we must
inquire into the "meaning" of the term probability. (The term "meaning" is in
quotes because it can be a confusing word.)

You have been using the notion of probability all your life when drawing
conclusions about what you expect to happen, and in reaching decisions in your
public and personal lives.

You wonder: Will the kick from the 45 yard line go through the uprights? How
much oil can you expect from the next well you drill, and what value should
you assign to that prospect?  Will you make money if you invest in tech stocks
for the medium term, or should you spread your investments across the stock
market?  Will the next Space-X launch end in disaster?  Your answers to these
questions rest on the probabilities you estimate.

And you act on the basis of probabilities: You pay extra for an low-interest
loan, if you think that interest rates are going to go up. You bet heavily on
a poker hand if there is a high probability that you have the best hand. A
hospital decides not to buy another ambulance when the administrator judges
that there is a low probability that all the other ambulances will ever be in
use at once. NASA decides whether or not to send off the space shuttle this
morning as scheduled.

The idea of probability is essential when we reason about uncertainty, and so
this chapter discusses what is meant by such key terms as "probability,"
"chance", "sample," and "universe." It discusses the nature and the usefulness
of the concept of probability as used in this book, and it touches on the
source of basic estimates of probability that are the raw material of
statistical inferences.

## The "Meaning" of "Probability"

Probability is difficult to define [@feller1991introduction], but here is a useful informal starting point:

> A probability is a number from 0 through 1 that reflects how likely it is
> that a particular event will happen.

Any particular stated probability is an assertion that indicates how likely
you believe it is that an event will occur.

If you give an event a probability of 0 you mean that you are certain it will
*not* happen.  If you give probability 1 to an event, you mean you are certain
that it *will* happen.  For example, if I give you one card from deck that you
know contains only the standard 52 cards — before you look at the card, you
can give probability 0 to the card being a joker, because you are certain the
pack does not contain any joker cards.   If I then select only the 14 spades
from that deck, and give you a card from that selection, you will say there is
probability 1 that the card is a black card, because all the spades are black
cards.

A probability estimate of .2 indicates that you think there is twice as great
a chance of the event happening as if you had estimated a probability of .1.
This is the rock-bottom interpretation of the term "probability," and the
heart of the concept.

The idea of probability arises when you are not sure about what will happen in
an uncertain situation. For example, you may lack information and therefore
can only make an estimate. If someone asks you your name, you do not use the
concept of probability to answer; you know the answer to a very high degree of
surety. To be sure, there is some chance that you do not know your own name,
but for all practical purposes you can be quite sure of the answer. If someone
asks you who will win tomorrow's baseball game, however, there is a
considerable chance that you will be wrong no matter what you say. Whenever
there is a reasonable chance that your prediction will be wrong, the concept
of probability can help you.

The concept of probability helps you to answer the question, "How likely
is it that...?" The purpose of the study of probability and statistics
is to help you make sound appraisals of statements about the future, and
good decisions based upon those appraisals. The concept of probability
is especially useful when you have a sample from a larger set of
data — a "universe" — and you want to know the probability of various
degrees of likeness between the sample and the universe. (The universe
of events you are sampling from is also called the "population," a
concept to be discussed below.) Perhaps the universe of your study is
all high school graduates in 2018. You might then want to know, for example,
the probability that the universe's average SAT (university entrance) score
will not differ from your sample's average SAT by more than some arbitrary
number of SAT points — say, ten points.

We have said that a probability statement is about the future. Well, usually.
Occasionally you might state a probability about your future knowledge of past
events — that is, "I think I'll find out that..." — or even about the unknown
past. (Historians use probabilities to measure their uncertainty about whether
events occurred in the past, and the courts do, too, though the courts
hesitate to say so explicitly.)

Sometimes one knows a probability, such as in the case of a gambler playing
black on an honest roulette wheel, or an insurance company issuing a policy on
an event with which it has had a lot of experience, such as a life insurance
policy. But often one does not *know* the probability of a future event.
Therefore, our concept of probability must include situations where extensive
data are not available.

All of the many techniques used to estimate probabilities should be thought of
as *proxies* for the actual probability. For example, if Mission Control at
Space Central simulates what should and probably will happen in space if a
valve is turned aboard a space craft just now being built, the test result on
the ground is a proxy for the real probability of what will happen when the
crew turn the valve in the planned mission.

In some cases, it is difficult to conceive of *any* data that can serve as a
proxy. For example, the director of the CIA, Robert Gates, said in 1993 "that
in May 1989, the CIA reported that the problems in the Soviet Union were so
serious and the situation so volatile that Gorbachev had only a 50-50 chance
of surviving the next three to four years unless he retreated from his reform
policies" (*The Washington Post* , January 17, 1993, p. A42). Can such a
statement be based on solid enough data to be more than a crude guess?

The conceptual probability in any specific situation is *an interpretation of
all the evidence that is then available* . For example, a wise biomedical
worker's estimate of the chance that a given therapy will have a positive
effect on a sick patient should be an interpretation of the results of not
just one study in isolation, but of the results of that study plus everything
else that is known about the disease and the therapy. A wise policymaker in
business, government, or the military will base a probability estimate on a
wide variety of information and knowledge. The same is even true of an
insurance underwriter who bases a life-insurance or shipping-insurance rate
not only on extensive tables of long-time experience but also on recent
knowledge of other kinds. Each situation asks us to make a choice of the best
method of estimating a probability — whether that estimate is *objective* —
from a frequency series — or *subjective*, from the distillation of other
experience.

## The nature and meaning of the concept of probability

It is confusing and unnecessary to inquire what probability "really" is.
(Indeed, the terms "really" and "is," alone or in combination, are major
sources of confusion in statistics and in other logical and scientific
discussions, and it is often wise to avoid their use.) Various concepts
of probability — which correspond to various common definitions of the
term — are useful in particular contexts.  This book contains many examples of
the use of probability. Work with them will gradually develop a sound
understanding of the concept.

There are two major concepts and points of view about probability —
*frequency* and *degrees of belief*. Each is useful in some situations but not
in others. Though they may seem incompatible in principle, there almost never
is confusion about which is appropriate in a given situation.

1.  *Frequency* . The probability of an event can be said to be the
    proportion of times that the event has taken place in the past,
    usually based on a long series of trials. Insurance companies use
    this when they estimate the probability that a thirty-five-year-old
    teacher will die during a period for which he wants to buy an
    insurance policy. (Notice this shortcoming: Sometimes you must bet
    upon events that have never or only infrequently taken place before,
    and so you cannot reasonably reckon the proportion of times they
    occurred one way or the other in the past.)

2.  *Degree of belief* . The probability that an event will take place or that
   a statement is true can be said to correspond to the odds at which you
   would bet that the event will take place. (Notice a shortcoming of this
   concept: You might be willing to accept a five-dollar bet at 2-1 odds that
   your team will win the game, but you might be unwilling to bet a hundred
   dollars at the same odds.)

See [@barnett1982comparative, chapter 3] for an in-depth
discussion of different approaches to probability.

The connection between gambling and immorality or vice troubles some people
about gambling examples. On the other hand, the immediacy and consequences of
the decisions that the gambler has to make give the subject a special tang.
There are several reasons why statistics use so many gambling examples — and
especially tossing coins, throwing dice, and playing cards:

1.  *Historical* . The theory of probability began with gambling
    examples of dice analyzed by Cardano, Galileo, and then by Pascal
    and Fermat.
2.  *Generality* . These examples are not related to any particular walk
    of life, and therefore they can be generalized to applications in
    any walk of life. Students in any field — business, medicine,
    science — can feel equally at home with gambling examples.
3.  *Sharpness* . These examples are particularly stark, and
    unencumbered by the baggage of particular walks of life or special
    uses.
4.  *Universality* . Many other texts use these same examples, and therefore
   the use of them connects up this book with the main body of writing about
   probability and statistics.

Often we'll begin with a gambling example and then consider an example
in one of the professional fields — such as business and other
decision-making activities, biostatistics and medicine, social science
and natural science — and everyday living. People in one field often can
benefit from examples in others; for example, medical students should
understand the need for business decision-making in terms of medical
practice, as well as the biostatistical examples. And social scientists
should understand the decision-making aspects of statistics if they have
any interest in the use of their work in public policy.

## Back to Proxies

Example of a proxy: The "probability risk assessments" (PRAs) that are
made for the chances of failures of nuclear power plants are based, not
on long experience or even on laboratory experiment, but rather on
theorizing of various kinds — using pieces of prior experience wherever
possible, of course. A PRA can cost a nuclear facility \$5 million.

Another example: If a manager of a high-street store looks at the sales of a
particular brand of smart watches in the last two Decembers, and on that basis
guesses how likely it is that she will run out of stock if she orders 200 smart
watches, then the last two years' experience is serving as a proxy for future
experience. If a sales manager just "intuits" that the odds are 3 to 1 (a
probability of .75) that the main local competitor will not meet a price cut,
then all her past experience summed into her intuition is a proxy for the
probability that it will really happen. Whether any proxy is a good or bad one
depends on the wisdom of the person choosing the proxy and making the
probability estimates.

How does one estimate a probability in practice? This involves practical
skills not very different from the practical skills required to estimate
with accuracy the length of a golf shot, the number of carpenters you
will need to build a house, or the time it will take you to walk to a
friend's house; we will consider elsewhere some ways to improve your
practical skills in estimating probabilities. For now, let us simply
categorize and consider in the next section various ways of estimating
an ordinary garden variety of probability, which is called an
"unconditional" probability.

## The various ways of estimating probabilities

Consider the probability of drawing an even-numbered spade from a deck
of poker cards (consider the queen as even and the jack and king as
odd). Here are several general methods of estimation, where we define each method in terms of the operations we use to make the estimate:

1.  **Experience.**

    The first possible source for an estimate of the probability of
    drawing an even-numbered spade is the purely empirical method of
    *experience* . If you have watched card games casually from time to
    time, you might simply guess at the proportion of times you have
    seen even-numbered spades appear — say, "about 1 in 15" or "about 1
    in 9" (which is almost correct) or something like that. (If you
    watch long enough you might come to estimate something like 6 in
    52.)

    General information and experience are also the source for
    estimating the probability that the sales of a particular brand of smart
    watch this December will be between 200 and 250, based on sales the last
    two Decembers; that your team will win the football game tomorrow; that
    war will break out next year; or that a United States astronaut will reach
    Mars before a Russian astronaut. You simply put together all your relevant
    prior experience and knowledge, and then make an educated guess.

    Observation of repeated events can help you estimate the probability
    that a machine will turn out a defective part or that a child can
    memorize four nonsense syllables correctly in one attempt. You watch
    repeated trials of similar events and record the results.

    Data on the mortality rates for people of various ages in a
    particular country in a given decade are the basis for estimating
    the probabilities of death, which are then used by the actuaries of
    an insurance company to set life insurance rates. This is
    *systematized experience* — called a *frequency series* .

    No frequency series can speak for itself in a perfectly objective
    manner. Many judgments inevitably enter into compiling every
    frequency series — deciding which frequency series to use for an
    estimate, choosing which part of the frequency series to use, and so
    on. For example, should the insurance company use only its records
    from last year, which will be too few to provide as much data as is
    preferable, or should it also use death records from years further
    back, when conditions were slightly different, together with data
    from other sources? (Of course, no two deaths — indeed, no events of
    any kind — are *exactly* the same. But under many circumstances they
    are *practically* the same, and science is only interested in such
    "practical" considerations.)

    Given that we have to use judgment in probability estimates, the reader
    may prefer to talk about "degrees of belief" instead of probabilities.
    That's fine, just as long as it is understood that we operate with degrees
    of belief in exactly the same way as we operate with probabilities; the
    two terms are working synonyms.

    There is no *logical* difference between the sort of probability
    that the life insurance company estimates on the basis of its
    "frequency series" of past death rates, and the manager's estimates
    of the sales of smart watches in December, based on sales in that month in
    the past two years.

    The concept of a probability based on a frequency series can be
    rendered almost useless when all the observations are repetitions of a
    single magnitude — for example, the case of all successes and zero
    failures of space-shuttle launches prior to the Challenger shuttle tragedy
    in the 1980s; in those data alone there was almost no basis to estimate
    the probability of a shuttle failure. (Probabilists have made some rather
    peculiar attempts over the centuries to estimate probabilities from the
    length of a zero-defect time series — such as the fact that the sun has
    never failed to rise (foggy days aside! — based on the undeniable fact
    that the longer such a series is, the smaller the probability of a
    failure; see e.g., [@whitworth1897dcc, pp. xix-xli]. However, one surely
    has more information on which to act when one has a long series of
    observations of the same magnitude rather than a short series).

2.  **Simulated experience.**

    A second possible source of probability estimates is empirical
    scientific investigation with repeated trials of the phenomenon.
    This is an empirical method even when the empirical trials are
    simulations. In the case of the even-numbered spades, the empirical
    scientific procedure is to shuffle the cards, deal one card, record
    whether or not the card is an even-number spade, replace the card, and
    repeat the steps a good many times. The proportions of times you observe
    an even-numbered spade come up is a probability estimate based on a
    frequency series.

    You might reasonably ask why we do not just *count* the number of
    even-numbered spades in the deck of fifty-two cards — using the *sample
    space analysis* you see below. No reason at all. But that procedure would
    not work if you wanted to estimate the probability of a baseball batter
    getting a hit or a cigarette lighter producing flame.

    Some varieties of poker are so complex that experiment is the only
    feasible way to estimate the probabilities a player needs to know.

    The resampling approach to statistics produces estimates of most
    probabilities with this sort of experimental "Monte Carlo" method.
    More about this later.

3.  **Sample space analysis and first principles.**

    A third source of probability estimates is *counting the
    possibilities* — the quintessential theoretical method. For
    example, by examination of an ordinary die one can determine that
    there are six different numbers that can come up. One can then
    determine that the probability of getting (say) either a "1" *or* a
    "2," on a single throw, is 2/6 = 1/3, because two among the six
    possibilities are "1" or "2." One can similarly determine that there
    are two possibilities of getting a "1" *plus* a "6" out of
    thirty-six possibilities when rolling two dice, yielding a
    probability estimate of 2/36 = 1/18.

    Estimating probabilities by counting the possibilities has two
    requirements: 1) that the possibilities all be known (and therefore
    limited), and few enough to be studied easily; and 2) that the probability
    of each particular possibility be known, for example, that the
    probabilities of all sides of the dice coming up are equal, that is, equal
    to 1/6.

4.  **Mathematical shortcuts to sample-space analysis.**

    A fourth source of probability estimates is *mathematical
    calculations* . If one knows by other means that the probability of
    a spade is 1/4 and the probability of an even-numbered card is 6/13,
    one can use probability calculation rules to calculate that the
    probability of turning up an even-numbered spade is 6/52 (that is, 1/4 x
    6/13). If one knows that the probability of a spade is 1/4 and the
    probability of a heart is 1/4, one can then calculate that the probability
    of getting a heart *or* a spade is 1/2 (that is 1/4 + 1/4). The point here
    is not the particular calculation procedures, which we will touch on
    later, but rather that one can often calculate the desired probability on
    the basis of already-known probabilities.

    It is possible to estimate probabilities with mathematical
    calculation only if one knows *by other means* the probabilities of
    some related events. For example, there is no possible way of
    mathematically calculating that a child will memorize four nonsense
    syllables correctly in one attempt; empirical knowledge is
    necessary.

5.  **Kitchen-sink methods.**

    In addition to the above four categories of estimation procedures, the
    statistical imagination may produce estimates in still other ways such
    as a) the salesman's seat-of-the-pants estimate of what the
    competition's price will be next quarter, based on who-knows-what
    gossip, long-time acquaintance with the competitors, and so on, and b)
    the probability risk assessments (PRAs) that are made for the chances of
    failures of nuclear power plants based, not on long experience or even
    on laboratory experiment, but rather on theorizing of various kinds —
    using pieces of prior experience wherever possible, of course. Any of
    these methods may be a combination of theoretical and empirical methods.

As an example of an organization struggling with kitchen-sink methods,
consider the estimation of the probability of failure for the tragic flight of
the Challenger shuttle, as described by the famous physicist Nobelist Richard
Feynman. This is a very real case that includes just about every sort of
complication that enters into estimating probabilities.

Feynman tried to ascertain more about the origins of the figure of 1 in
100,000 that entered into NASA's calculations. He performed an  experiment
with the engineers:

We see in the Challenger shuttle case very mixed kinds of inputs to actual
estimates of probabilities. They include frequency series of past flights of
other rockets, judgments about the relevance of experience with that different
sort of rocket, adjustments for special temperature conditions (cold), and
much much more. There also were complex computational processes in arriving at
the probabilities that were made the basis for the launch decision. And most
impressive of all, of course, are the extraordinary differences in estimates
made by various persons (or perhaps we should talk of various statuses and
roles) which make a mockery of the notion of objective estimation in this
case.

Working with different sorts of estimation methods in different sorts of
situations is not new; practical statisticians do so all the time. We argue
that we should make no apology for doing so.

The concept of probability varies from one field of endeavor to another;
it is different in the law, in science, and in business. The concept is
most straightforward in decision-making situations such as business and
gambling; there it is crystal-clear that one's interest is entirely in
making accurate predictions so as to advance the interests of oneself
and one's group. The concept is most difficult in social science, where
there is considerable doubt about the aims and values of an
investigation. In sum, one should not think of what a probability "is"
but rather how best to estimate it. In practice, neither in actual
decision-making situations nor in scientific work — nor in classes — do
people experience difficulties estimating probabilities because of
philosophical confusions. Only philosophers and mathematicians
worry — and even they really do not *need* to worry — about the
"meaning" of probability[^on-work].

[^on-work]: This does not mean that I think that people should confine their
  learning to what they need in their daily work. Having a deeper
  philosophical knowledge than you ordinarily need can help you deal with
  extraordinary problems when they arise.

## The relationship of probability to other magnitudes

An important argument in favor of approaching the concept of probability
as an *estimate* is that an estimate of a probability often (though not
always) is the opposite side of the coin from an estimate of a physical
quantity such as time or space.

For example, uncertainty about the probability that one will finish a
task within 9 minutes is another way of labeling the uncertainty that
the time required to finish the task will be less than 9 minutes. Hence,
if estimation is appropriate for time in this case, it should be equally
appropriate for probability. The same is true for the probability that the
quantity of smart watches sold will be between 200 and 250 units.

Hence the concept of probability, and its estimation in any particular
case, should be no more puzzling than is the "dual" concept of time or
distance or quantities of smart watches. That is, lack of certainty about the
probability that an event will occur is not different in nature from lack of
certainty about the amount of time or distance in the event. There is no
essential difference between whether a part 2 inches in length will be the
next to emerge from the machine, or what the length of the next part will be,
or the length of the part that just emerged (if it has not yet been measured).

The information available for the measurement of (say) the length of a
car or the location of a star is exactly the same information that is
available with respect to the concept of probability in those situations. That
is, one may have ten disparate observations of a car's length which then
constitute a probability distribution, and the same for the altitude of a star
in the heavens. 

In a book of puzzles about probability [@mosteller1987fifty, problem 42], this
problem appears: "If a stick is broken in two at random, what is the average
length of the smaller piece?" This particular puzzle does not even mention
probability explicitly, and no one would feel the need to write a scholarly
treatise on the meaning of the word "length" here, any more than one would one
do so if the question were about an astronomer's average observation of the
angle of a star at a given time or place, or the average height of boards cut
by a carpenter, or the average size of a basketball team. Nor would one write
a treatise about the "meaning" of "time" if a similar puzzle involved the
average time between two bird calls. Yet a rephrasing of the problem reveals
its tie to the concept of probability, to wit: What is the probability that
the smaller piece will be (say) more than half the length of the larger piece?
Or, what is the probability distribution of the sizes of the shorter piece?

The duality of the concepts of probability and physical entities also
emerges in Whitworth's discussion [-@whitworth1897dcc] of fair betting odds:

> ...What sum ought you fairly give or take now, while the event is
undetermined, in exchange for the assurance that you shall receive a stated
sum (say \$1,000) if the favourable event occur? The chance of receiving
\$1,000 is worth something. It is not as good as the certainty of receiving
\$1,000, and therefore it is worth less than \$1,000. But the prospect or
expectation or chance, however slight, is a commodity which may be bought and
sold. It must have its price somewhere between zero and \$1,000. (p. xix.)

> ...And the ratio of the expectation to the full sum to be received is
what is called the chance of the favourable event. For instance, if we say
that the chance is 1/5, it is equivalent to saying that \$200 is the fair
price of the contingent \$1,000. (p. xx.)...

> The fair price can sometimes be calculated mathematically from *a
priori* considerations: sometimes it can be deduced from statistics, that is,
from the recorded results of observation and experiment. Sometimes it can only
be estimated generally, the estimate being founded on a limited knowledge or
experience. If your expectation depends on the drawing of a ticket in a
raffle, the fair price can be calculated from abstract considerations: if it
depend upon your outliving another person, the fair price can be inferred from
recorded statistics: if it depend upon a benefactor not revoking his will, the
fair price depends upon the character of your benefactor, his habit of
changing his mind, and other circumstances upon the knowledge of which you
base your estimate. But if in any of these cases you determine that \$300 is
the sum which you ought fairly to accept for your prospect, this is equivalent
to saying that your chance, whether calculated or estimated, is 3/10\... (p.
xx.)

It is indubitable that along with frequency data, a wide variety of other
information will affect the odds at which a reasonable person will bet. If the
two concepts of probability stand on a similar footing here, why should they
not be on a similar footing in *all* discussion of probability?  I can think
of no reason that they should not be so treated.

Scholars write about the "discovery" of the concept of probability in
one century or another. But is it not likely that even in pre-history,
when a fisherperson was asked how long the big fish was, s/he sometimes
extended her/his arms and said, "About this long, but I'm not exactly
sure," and when a scout was asked how many of the enemy there were, s/he
answered, "I don't know for sure\...probably about fifty." The
uncertainty implicit in these statements is the functional equivalent of
probability statements. There simply is no need to make such heavy work of the
probability concept as the philosophers and mathematicians and historians have
done.

## What is "chance"?

The study of probability focuses on events with randomness — that is,
events about which there is uncertainty whether or not they will occur. And
the uncertainty refers to your knowledge rather than to the event itself. For
example, consider this physical illustration with a remote control.  The remote control has a *front end* that should point at the TV that is controls, and a *back end* that will usually be pointing at me, the user of the remote control.  Call the front — the *TV end*, and the back — *the sofa end* of the remote control.

I spin the remote control like a baton twirler. If I hold it at the sofa end
and attempt to flip it so that it turns only half a revolution, I can be
almost sure that I will correctly get the TV end and not the sofa end.
And if I attempt to flip it a full revolution, again I can almost surely
get the sofa end successfully. It is not a random event whether I catch
the sofa end or the TV end (here ignoring those throws when I catch neither
end) when doing only half a revolution or one revolution. The result is quite
predictable in both these simple maneuvers so far.

When I say the result is "predictable," I mean that you would not bet
with me about whether this time I'll get the TV or the sofa end. So we say
that the outcome of my flip aiming at half a revolution is not "random."

When I twirl the remote control so little, I *control* (almost completely)
whether the sofa end or the TV end comes down to my hand; this is the same as
saying that the outcome does not occur by chance.

The terms "random" and "chance" implicitly mean that you believe that I
cannot control or cannot know in advance what will happen.

Whether this twirl will be the rare time I miss, however, *should* be
considered chance. Though you would not bet at even odds on my catching
the sofa end versus the TV end if there is to be only a half or one
full revolution, you might bet — at (say) odds of 50 to 1 — that I will make a
mistake and get it wrong, or drop it. So the very same flip can be seen as
random or determined depending on what aspect of it we are looking at.

Of course you would not bet *against* me about my *not* making a mistake,
because the bet might *cause* me to make a mistake purposely. This "moral
hazard" is a problem that emerges when a person buys life insurance and may
commit suicide, or when a boxer may lose a fight purposely. The people who
stake money on those events say that such an outcome is "fixed" (a very
appropriate word) and not random.

Now I attempt more difficult maneuvers with the remote control. I can do
$1\frac{1}{2}$ flips pretty well, and two full revolutions with some success —
maybe even $2\frac{1}{2}$ flips on a good day. But when I get much beyond
that, I cannot determine very well whether I'll get the sofa or the TV end.
The outcome gradually becomes less and less predictable — that is, more and
more random.

If I flip the remote control so that it revolves three or more times, I can
hardly control the process at all, and hence I cannot predict well whether
I'll get the sofa end or the TV end. With 5 revolutions I have absolutely no
control over the outcome; I cannot predict the outcome better than 50-50. At
that point, getting the sofa end or the TV end has become a completely random
event for our purposes, just like flipping a coin high in the air. So at that
point we say that "chance" controls the outcome, though that word is just a
synonym for my lack of ability to control and predict the outcome. "Chance"
can be thought to stand for the myriad small factors that influence the
outcome.

We see the same gradual increase in randomness with increasing numbers of
shuffles of cards. After one shuffle, a skilled magician can know where every
card is, and after two shuffles there is still much order that s/he can work
with. But after (say) five shuffles, the magician no longer has any power to
predict and control, and the outcome of any draw can then be thought of as
random chance.

At what point do we say that the outcome is "random" or "pure chance" as to
whether my hand will grasp the TV end, the sofa end, or at some other spot?
*There is no sharp boundary to this transition.* Rather, the transition is
gradual; this is the crucial idea, and one that I have not seen stated before.

Whether or not we refer to the outcome as random depends upon the twirler's
skill, which influences how predictable the event is. A baton twirler or
juggler might be able to do ten flips with a non-random outcome; if the
twirler is an expert and the outcome is highly predictable, we say it is not
random but rather is determined.

Again, this shows that the randomness is not a property of the physical event,
but rather of a person's knowledge and skill.

## What Do We Mean by "Random"? {#sec-what-is-chance}

We have defined "chance" and "random* as the absence of predictive power
and/or explanation and/or control. Here we should not confuse the concepts of
determinacy-indeterminacy and predictable-unpredictable. What matters for
*decision purposes* is whether you can predict. Whether the process is
"really" determinate is largely a matter of definition and labeling, an
unnecessary philosophical controversy for our purposes (and
perhaps for any other purpose) [^quanta-decisions].

[^quanta-decisions]: The idea that our aim is to advance our work in improving
  our knowledge and our decisions, rather than to answer "ultimate" questions
  about what is "really" true is in the same spirit as some writing about
  quantum theory. In 1930
  [Ruarck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Edward_Ruark) and
  [Urey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Urey) wrote: "The reader who
  feels disappointed that the information sought in solving a dynamical
  problem on the quantum theory is \[only\] statistical ... should console
  himself with the thought that we seldom need any information other than that
  which is given by the quantum theory." [-@ruark1930atoms, p. 622].

The remote control in the previous demonstration *becomes* unpredictable —
that is, random — even though it still is subject to similar physical
processes as when it is predictable. I do not deny *in principle* that these
processes can be "understood," or that one could produce a machine that would
— like a baton twirler — make the course of the remote control predictable for
many turns. But in *practice* we cannot make the predictions — and it is the
*practical reality*, rather than the principle, that matters here.

When I flip the remote control half a turn or one turn, I control (almost
completely) whether it comes down at the sofa end end or the TV end, so we do
not say that the outcome is chance. Much the same can be said about what
happens to the predictability of drawing a given card as one increases the
number of times one shuffles a deck of cards.

Consider, too, a set of fake dice that I roll. Before you know they are
fake, you assume that the probabilities of various outcomes is a matter
of chance. But after you know that the dice are loaded, you no longer
assume that the outcome is chance. This illustrates how the
probabilities you work with are influenced by your knowledge of the
facts of the situation.

Admittedly, this way of thinking about probability takes some getting used to.
Events may appear to be random, but in fact, we can predict them — and *visa
versa*. For example, suppose a magician does a simple trick with dice such as
this one:

> The magician turns her back while a spectator throws three dice on the
table. He is instructed to add the faces. He then picks up any *one* die,
adding the number on the *bottom* to the previous total. This same die is
rolled again. The number it now shows is also added to the total. The magician
turns around. She calls attention to the fact that she has no way of knowing
which of the three dice was used for the second roll. She picks up the dice,
shakes them in her hand a moment, then correctly announces the final sum.

**Method:**.  When the spectator rolls the dice, they get three numbers, one
from each of the three dice.  Call these numbers $a$, $b$ and $c$.  Then he
chooses one die — it doesn't matter which, but let's say he chooses the third
die, with value $c$.  He adds the bottom of the third die to the total.
Here's the trick — the total of opposite faces on a standard die always add up
to 7 — 1 is opposite 6, 2 is opposite 5, and 3 is opposite 4.  So the total is
now $a + b + 7$.  Then the spectator rolls the third die again, to get a new
number $d$.  The total is now $a + b + 7 + d$.  When the magician turns round
she can see what $a$ and $b$ and $d$ are, so to get the right final total, she
just needs to add 7 [@gardner2020mathematical, p259].  Ben Sparks does a [nice
demonstration of the trick on Numerphile
YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kviwvLpnZSY).

The point here is that, until you know the trick, you (the magician) cannot
predict the final sum, so the magician and the spectator consider the result
as random.  If you do know the trick, you can predict the result, and it is
not random.  Whether something is "random" or not, depends on what you know.

Consider the distributions of heights of various groups of living things
(including people). When we consider all living things taken together, the
shape of the overall distribution — many individuals at the tiny end where the
viruses are found, and very few individuals at the tall end where the giraffes
are — is determined mostly by the distribution of species that have different
mean heights. Hence we can explain the shape of that distribution, and we do
not say that is determined by "chance." But with a homogenous cohort of a
single species — say, all 25-year-old human females in the U.S. — our best
description of the shape of the distribution is "chance." With situations in
between, the shape is partly due to identifiable factors — e.g. age — and
partly due to "chance."

Or consider the case of a basketball shooter: What causes her or him to
make (or not make) a basket this shot, after a string of successes? Much must
be ascribed to chance variation. But what causes a given shooter to be very
good or very poor relative to other players? For that explanation we can point
to such factors as the amount of practice or natural talent.

Again, all this has nothing to do with whether the mechanism is "really"
chance, unlike the arguments that have been raging in physics for a century.
That is the point of the remote control demonstration. Our knowledge and our
power to predict the outcome gradually transits from non-chance (that is,
"determined") to chance ("not determined") in a gradual way even though the
same sort of physical mechanism produces each throw of the remote control.

Earlier I mentioned that when we say that chance controls the outcome of
the remote control flip after (say) five revolutions, we mean that there are
many small forces that affect the outcome. The effect of each force is not
known, and each is independent of the other. None of these forces is large
enough for me (as the remote control twirler) to deal with, or else I would
deal with it and be able to improve my control and my ability to predict the
outcome. This concept of many small influences — "small" meaning in practice
those influences whose effects cannot be identified and allowed for — which
affect the outcome and whose effects are not knowable and which are
independent of each other is important in statistical inference.  For example,
as we will see later, when we add many unpredictable deviations together, and
plot the distribution of the result, we end up with the famous and very common
bell-shaped *normal distribution* — this striking result comes about because
of a mathematical phenomenon called the Central Limit Theorem.  We will show this at work, later in the book.

## Randomness from the computer

We now have the idea of *random* variation as being variation we cannot
predict.  For example, when we flip the remote control through many rotations,
we can no longer easily predict which end will land in our hand.  We can call
the result of any particular flip — *random* — because we cannot predict whether the result will be TV end or sofa end.

We still know some things about the result — it will be one of two options —
TV or sofa (unless we drop it).  But we cannot predict which. We say the
result of each flip is *random* if we cannot do anything to improve our
prediction of 50% for TV (or sofa) end on the next flip.

We are not saying the result *is* random in any deep, non-deterministic sense — we are only saying we can treat the result as random, because we cannot predict it.

Now consider getting *random* numbers from the computer, where the numbers can
either be 0 or 1.  This is rather like tossing a fair coin, where the results
are 0 and 1 rather than "heads" and "tails".

When we ask the computer for a random choice between 0 and 1, we accept
it is random-enough, or random-like, if we can't do anything to predict which
of 0 or 1 we will get on any one trial.  We can't do better than guessing that
the next value will be — say — 0 — and whichever number we guess, we will only
ever have a 50% chance of being correct.  We are not saying the computer is
giving *truly* random numbers in some deep sense, only numbers we cannot
*distinguish* from truly random numbers, because we cannot do anything to
predict them.  The technical term for random numbers from the computer is
therefore *pseudo-random* — meaning, like random numbers, in the sense they
are effectively unpredictable. Effectively unpredictable means there is no
*practical* way for you, or even a very powerful computer, to do anything to
improve your prediction of the next number in the series.

## The philosophers' dispute about the concept of probability

Those who call themselves "objectivists" or "frequentists" and those who
call themselves "personalists" or "Bayesians" have been arguing for
hundreds or even thousands of years about the "nature" of probability.
The objectivists insist (correctly) that any estimation not based on a
series of observations is subject to potential bias, from which they
conclude (incorrectly) that we should never think of probability that
way. They are worried about the perversion of science, the substitution
of arbitrary assessments for value-free data-gathering. The personalists
argue (correctly) that in many situations it is not possible to obtain
sufficient data to avoid considerable judgment. Indeed, if a probability
is about the future, some judgment is *always* required — about which
observations will be relevant, and so on. They sometimes conclude
(incorrectly) that the objectivists' worries are unimportant.

As is so often the case, the various sides in the argument have
different sorts of situations in mind. As we have seen, the arguments
disappear if one thinks *operationally* with respect to the *purpose of
the work*, rather than in terms of *properties*, as mentioned earlier.

Here is an example of the difficulty of focusing on the supposed
properties of the mechanism or situation: The mathematical theorist
asserts that the probability of a die falling with the "5" side up is
1/6, on the basis of the physics of equally-weighted sides. But if one
rolls a particular die a million times, and it turns up "5" less than
1/6 of the time, one surely would use the observed proportion as the
practical estimate. The probabilities of various outcomes with cheap
dice may depend upon the number of pips drilled out on a side. In 20,000
throws of a red die and 20,000 throws of a white die, the proportions of
3's and 4's were, respectively, .159 and .146, .145 and .142 — all far below
the expected proportions of .167. That is, 3's and 4's occurred about 11
percent less often that if the dice had been perfectly formed, a difference
that could make a big difference in a gambling game [@bulmer1979principles, p.
18].

It is reasonable to think of both the *engineering* method (the
theoretical approach) and the *empirical* method (experimentation and
data collection) as two alternative ways to estimate a probability. The
two methods use different processes and different proxies for the
probability you wish to estimate. One must adduce additional knowledge
to decide which method to use in any given situation. It is sensible to
use the empirical method when data are available. (But use both together
whenever possible.)

In view of the inevitably subjective nature of probability estimates,
you may prefer to talk about "degrees of belief" instead of
probabilities. That's fine, just as long as it is understood that we
operate with degrees of belief in exactly the same way as we operate
with probabilities. The two terms are working synonyms.

Most important: One cannot sensibly talk about probabilities in the
abstract, without reference to some set of facts. The topic then loses
its meaning, and invites confusion and argument. This also is a reason
why a general formalization of the probability concept does not make
sense.

## The relationship of probability to the concept of resampling

There is no all-agreed definition of the concept of the resampling
method in statistics. Unlike some other writers, I prefer to apply the
term to problems in *both* pure probability and statistics. This set of
examples may illustrate:

1.  Consider asking about the number of hits one would expect from a
    .250 (25 percent) batter in a 400 at-bat season. One would call this
    a problem in "probability." The sampling distribution of the
    batter's results can be calculated by formula or produced by Monte
    Carlo simulation.

2.  Now consider examining the number of hits in a given batter's
    season, and asking how likely that number (or fewer) is to occur by
    chance if the batter's long-run batting average is

    .250. One would call this a problem in "statistics." But just as in
    example (1) above, the answer can be calculated by formula or
    produced by Monte Carlo simulation. And the calculation or
    simulation is exactly the same as used in (1).

    Here the term "resampling" might be applied to the simulation with
    considerable agreement among people familiar with the term, but
    perhaps not by all such persons.

3.  Next consider an observed distribution of distances that a batter's
    hits travel in a season with 100 hits, with an observed mean of 150
    feet per hit. One might ask how likely it is that a sample of 10
    hits drawn with replacement from the observed distribution of hit
    lengths (with a mean of 150 feet) would have a mean greater than 160
    feet, and one could easily produce an answer with repeated Monte
    Carlo samples. Traditionally this would be called a problem in
    probability.

4.  Next consider that a batter gets 10 hits with a mean of 160 feet,
    and one wishes to estimate the probability that the sample would be
    produced by a distribution as specified in (3). This is a problem in
    statistics, and by 1996, it is common statistical practice to treat
    it with a resampling method. The actual simulation would, however,
    be identical to the work described in (3).

Because the work in (4) and (2) differ only in question (4) involving
measured data and question (2) involving counted data, there seems no
reason to discriminate between the two cases with respect to the term
"resampling." With respect to the pairs of cases (1) and (2), and (3)
and (4), there is no difference in the actual work performed, though
there is a difference in the way the question is framed. I would
therefore urge that the label "resampling" be applied to (1) and (3) as
well as to (2) and (4), to bring out the important fact that the
procedure is the same as in resampling questions in statistics.

One could easily produce examples like (1) and (2) for cases that are
similar except that the drawing is without replacement, as in the
sampling version of Fisher's permutation test — for example, a tea
taster. And one could adduce the example of prices in different state
liquor control systems (see TKTK) which is similar to cases (3) and (4) except
that sampling without replacement seems appropriate. Again, the analogs to
cases (2) and (4) would generally be called "resampling."

The concept of resampling is defined in a more precise way in Chapter
TKTK.

## Conclusion

We define "chance" as the absence of predictive power and/ or
explanation and/or control.

When the TV rotates more than three or four turns I cannot control
the outcome — whether TV or sofa end — with any accuracy. That is to
say, I cannot predict much better than 50-50 with more than four
rotations. So we then say that the outcome is determined by "chance."

As to those persons who wish to inquire into what the situation "really"
is: I hope they agree that we do not need to do so to proceed with our
work. I hope all will agree that the outcome of flipping the TV
gradually *becomes* unpredictable (random) though still subject to
similar physical processes as when predictable. I do not deny *in
principle* that these processes can be "understood," certainly one can
develop a machine (or a baton twirler) that will make the outcome
predictable for many turns. But this has nothing to do with whether the
mechanism is "really" something one wants to say is influenced by
"chance." This is the point of the cooking-TV demonstration. The outcome traverses from non-chance (determined) to chance
(not determined) in a smooth way even though the physical mechanism that
produces the revolutions remains much the same over the traverse.
