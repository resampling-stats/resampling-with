# Correlation and Causation

## Preview

The correlation (speaking in a loose way for now) between two variables
measures the strength of the relationship between them. A positive
"linear" correlation between two variables x and y implies that high
values of x are associated with high values of y, and that low values of
x are associated with low values of y. A negative correlation implies
the opposite; high values of x are associated with *low* values of y. By
definition a "correlation coefficient" close to zero indicates little or
no linear relationship between two variables; correlation coefficients
close to 1 and -1 denote a strong positive or negative relationship. We
will generally use a simpler measure of correlation than the correlation
coefficient, however.

One way to measure correlation with the resampling method is to rank
both variables from highest to lowest, and investigate how often in
randomly-generated samples the rankings of the two variables are as
close to each other as the rankings in the observed variables. A better
approach, because it uses more of the quantitative information contained
in the data though it requires more computation, is to multiply the
values for the corresponding pairs of values for the two variables, and
compare the sum of the resulting products to the analogous sum for
randomly-generated pairs of the observed variable values. The last
section of the chapter shows how the strength of a relationship can be
determined when the data are counted, rather than measured. First comes
some discussion of the philosophical issues involved in correlation and
causation.

## Introduction to correlation and causation

The questions in Examples 7-1 to 8-3 have been stated in the following
form: Does the independent variable (say, irradiation; or type of pig
ration) have an effect upon the dependent variable (say, sex of fruit
flies; or weight gain of pigs)? This is another way to state the
following question: Is there a *causal relationship* between the
independent variable(s) and the dependent variable? ("Independent" or
"control" is the name we give to the variable(s) the researcher believes
is (are) responsible for changes in the other variable, which we call
the "dependent" or "response" variable.)

A causal relationship cannot be defined perfectly neatly. Even an
experiment does not determine perfectly whether a relationship deserves
to be called "causal" because, among other reasons, the independent
variable may not be clear-cut. For example, even if cigarette smoking
experimentally produces cancer in rats, it might be the paper and not
the tobacco that causes the cancer. Or consider the fabled gentlemen who
got experimentally drunk on bourbon and soda on Monday night, scotch and
soda on Tuesday night, and brandy and soda on Wednesday night — and
stayed sober Thursday night by drinking nothing. With a vast inductive
leap of scientific imagination, they treated their experience as an
empirical demonstration that soda, the common element each evening, was
the cause of the inebriated state they had experienced. Notice that
their deduction was perfectly sound, given only the recent evidence they
had. Other knowledge of the world is necessary to set them straight.
That is, even in a controlled experiment there is often no way except
subject-matter knowledge to avoid erroneous conclusions about causality.
Nothing except substantive knowledge or scientific intuition would have
led them to the recognition that it is the alcohol rather than the soda
that made them drunk, *as long as they always took soda with their
drinks* . And no statistical procedure can suggest to them that they
ought to experiment with the presence and absence of soda. If this is
true for an experiment, it must also be true for an uncontrolled study.

Here are some tests that a relationship usually must pass to be called
causal. That is, a working definition of a particular causal
relationship is expressed in a statement that has these important
characteristics:

1.  It is an association that is strong enough so that the observer
    believes it to have a predictive (explanatory) power great enough to
    be scientifically useful or interesting. For example, he is not
    likely to say that wearing glasses causes (or is a cause of) auto
    accidents if the observed correlation is .07, even if the sample is
    large enough to make the correlation statistically significant. In
    other words, unimportant relationships are not likely to be labeled
    causal.

    Various observers may well differ in judging whether or not an
    association is strong enough to be important and therefore "causal."
    And the particular field in which the observer works may affect this
    judgment. This is an indication that whether or not a relationship
    is dubbed "causal" involves a good deal of human judgment and is
    subject to dispute.

2.  The "side conditions" must be sufficiently *few* and sufficiently
    observable so that the relationship will apply under a wide enough
    range of conditions to be considered useful or interesting. In other
    words, *the relationship must not require too many "if"s, "and"s,
    and "but"s in order to hold* . For example, one might say that an
    increase in income caused an increase in the birth rate if this
    relationship were observed everywhere. But, if the relationship were
    found to hold only in developed countries, among the educated
    classes, and among the higher-income groups, then it would be less
    likely to be called "causal" — even if the correlation were
    extremely high once the specified conditions had been met. A similar
    example can be made of the relationship between income and
    happiness.

3.  For a relationship to be called "causal," there should be sound
    reason to believe that, even if the control variable were not the
    "real" cause (and it never is), other relevant "hidden" and "real"
    cause variables must also change *consistently* with changes in the
    control variables. That is, a variable being manipulated may
    reasonably be called "causal" if the real variable for which it is
    believed to be a proxy must always be tied intimately to it.
    (Between two variables, v and w, v may be said to be the "more real"
    cause and *w* a "spurious" cause, if *v* and *w* require the same
    side conditions, except that *v* does not require *w* as a side
    condition.) This third criterion (non-spuriousness) is of particular
    importance to policy makers. The difference between it and the
    previous criterion for side conditions is that a plenitude of very
    restrictive side conditions may take the relationship out of the
    class of causal relationships, *even though the effects of the side
    conditions are known* . This criterion of nonspuriousness concerns
    variables that are as yet *unknown and unevaluated* but that have a
    *possible* ability to *upset* the observed association.

    Examples of spurious relationships and hidden-third-factor causation
    are commonplace. For a single example, toy sales rise in December.
    There is no danger in saying that December causes an increase in toy
    sales, even though it is "really" Christmas that causes the
    increase, because Christmas and December practically always
    accompany each other.

    Belief that the relationship is not spurious is increased if *many*
    likely variables have been investigated and none removes the
    relationship. This is further demonstration that the test of whether
    or not an association should be called "causal" cannot be a logical
    one; there is no way that one can express in symbolic logic the fact
    that many other variables have been tried without changing the
    relationship in question.

4.  The more tightly a relationship is bound into (that is, deduced
    from, compatible with, and logically connected to) a general
    framework of theory, the stronger is its claim to be called
    "causal." For an economics example, observed positive relationships
    between the interest rate and business investment and between
    profits and investment are more likely to be called "causal" than is
    the relationship between liquid assets and investment. This is so
    because the first two statements can be deduced from classical price
    theory, whereas the third statement cannot. Connection to a
    theoretical framework provides support for belief that the side
    conditions necessary for the statement to hold true are not
    restrictive and that the likelihood of spurious correlation is not
    great; because a statement is logically connected to the rest of the
    system, the statement tends to stand or fall as the rest of the
    system stands or falls. And, because the rest of the system of
    economic theory has, over a long period of time and in a wide
    variety of tests, been shown to have predictive power, a statement
    connected with it is cloaked in this mantle.

The social sciences other than economics do not have such well-developed
bodies of deductive theory, and therefore this criterion of causality
does not weigh as heavily in sociology, for instance, as in economics.
Rather, the other social sciences seem to substitute a weaker and more
general criterion, that is, whether or not the statement of the
relationship is accompanied by other statements that seem to "explain"
the "mechanism" by which the relationship operates. Consider, for
example, the relationship between the phases of the moon and the suicide
rate. The reason that sociologists do not call it causal is that there
are no auxiliary propositions that explain the relationship and describe
an operative mechanism. On the other hand, the relationship between
broken homes and juvenile delinquency is often referred to as "causal,"
in large part because a large body of psychoanalytic theory serves to
explain why a child raised without one or the other parent, or in the
presence of parental strife, should not adjust readily.

Furthermore, one can never decide with perfect certainty whether in any
*given* situation one variable "causes" a particular change in another
variable. At best, given your particular purposes in investigating a
phenomena, you may be safe in judging that very likely there is causal
influence.

In brief, it is correct to say (as it is so often said) that correlation
does not prove causation — if we add the word "completely" to make it
"correlation does not *completely* prove causation." On the other hand,
causation can *never* be "proven" *completely* by correlation *or any
other* tool or set of tools, including experimentation. The best we can
do is make informed judgments about whether to call a relationship
causal.

It is clear, however, that in any situation where we are interested in
the possibility of causation, we must *at least* know whether there is a
relationship (correlation) between the variables of interest; the
existence of a relationship is necessary for a relationship to be judged
causal even if it is not sufficient to receive the causal label. And in
other situations where we are not even interested in causality, but
rather simply want to predict events or understand the structure of a
system, we may be interested in the existence of relationships quite
apart from questions about causations. Therefore our next set of
problems deals with the probability of there being a relationship
between two measured variables, variables that can take on any values
(say, the values on a test of athletic scores) rather than just two
values (say, whether or not there has been irradiation.)

Another way to think about such problems is to ask whether two variables
are *independent* of each other — that is, whether you know anything
about the value of one variable if you know the value of the other in a
particular case — or whether they are not independent but rather are
related.

## A Note on Association Compared to Testing a Hypothesis

Problems in which we investigate a) whether there is an *association* ,
versus b) whether there is a *difference* between just two groups, often
look very similar, especially when the data constitute a 2-by-2 table.
There is this important difference between the two types of analysis,
however: Questions about *association* refer to *variables* — say
weight and age — and it never makes sense to ask whether there is a
difference between variables (except when asking whether they measure
the same quantity). Questions about *similarity or difference* refer to
*groups of individuals* , and in such a situation it does make sense to
ask whether or not two groups are observably different from each other.

**Example 23-1: Is Athletic Ability Directly Related to Intelligence?**
(Is There Correlation Between Two Variables or Are They Independent?)
(Program "Ability1")

A scientist often wants to know whether or not two characteristics go
together, that is, whether or not they are correlated (that is, related
or associated). For example, do youths with high athletic ability tend
to also have high I.Q.s?

Hypothetical physical-education scores of a group of ten high-school
boys are shown in Table 23-1, ordered from high to low, along with the
I.Q. score for each boy. The ranks for each student's athletic and I.Q.
scores are then shown in columns 3 and 4.

  -------------------- ---------------- ------------------- --------------

We want to know whether a high score on athletic ability tends to be
found along with a high I.Q. score more often than would be expected by
chance. Therefore, our strategy is to see how often high scores on
*both* variables are found by chance. We do this by disassociating the
two variables and making two separate and independent universes, one
composed of the athletic scores and another of the I.Q. scores. Then we
draw pairs of observations from the two universes at random, and compare
the experimental patterns that occur by chance to what actually is
observed to occur in the world.

The first testing scheme we shall use is similar to our first approach
to the pig rations — splitting the results into just "highs" and "lows."
We take ten cards, one of each denomination from "ace" to "10," shuffle,
and deal five cards to correspond to the first five athletic ranks. The
face values then correspond to the

I.Q. ranks. Under the benchmark hypothesis the athletic ranks will not
be associated with the I.Q. ranks. Add the face values in the first five
cards in each trial; the first hand includes 2, 4, 5, 6, and 9, so the
sum is 26. Record, shuffle, and repeat perhaps ten times. Then compare
the random results to the sum of the observed ranks of the five top
athletes, which equals 17.

The following steps describe a slightly different procedure than that
just described, because this one may be easier to understand:

**Step 1.** Convert the athletic and I.Q. scores to ranks. Then
constitute a universe of spades, "ace" to "10," to correspond to the
athletic ranks, and a universe of hearts, "ace" to "10," to correspond
to the IQ ranks.

**Step 2.** Deal out the well-shuffled cards into pairs, each pair with
an athletic score and an I.Q. score.

**Step 3.** Locate the cards with the top five athletic ranks, and add
the I.Q. rank scores on their paired cards. Compare this sum to the
observed sum of 17. If 17 or less, indicate "yes," otherwise "no." (Why
do we use "17 or less" rather than "less than 17"? Because we are asking
the probability of a score *this low or lower* .)

**Step 4.** Repeat steps 2 and 3 ten times.

**Step 5.** Calculate the proportion "yes." This estimates the
probability sought.

In Table 23-2 we see that the observed sum (17) is lower than the sum of
the top 5 ranks in all but one (shown by an asterisk) of the ten random
trials (trial 5), which suggests that there is a good chance (9 in 10)
that the five best athletes will not have I.Q. scores that high by
chance. But it might be well to deal some more to get a more reliable
average. We add thirty hands, and thirty-nine of the total forty hands
exceed the observed rank value, so the probability that the observed
correlation of athletic and I.Q. scores would occur by chance is about

.025. In other words, if there is no real association between the
variables, the probability that the top 5 ranks would sum to a number
this low or lower is only 1 in 40, and it therefore seems reasonable to
believe that high athletic ability tends to accompany a high I.Q.

The RESAMPLING STATS program "Ability1" creates an array containing the
I.Q. rankings of the top 5 students in athletics. The SUM of these I.Q.
rankings constitutes the observed result to be tested against
randomly-drawn samples. We observe that the actual I.Q. rankings of the
top five athletes sums to 17. The more frequently that the sum of 5
randomly-generated rankings (out of 10) is as low as this observed
number, the higher is the probability that there is no relationship
between athletic performance and I.Q. based on these data.

First we record the NUMBERS "1" through "10" into vector

A. Then we SHUFFLE the numbers so the rankings are in a random order.
Then TAKE the first 5 of these numbers and put them in another array, D,
and SUM them, putting the result in E. We repeat this procedure 1000
times, recording each result in a scorekeeping vector: Z. Graphing Z, we
get a HIS- TOGRAM that shows us how often our randomly assigned sums are
equal to or below 17.

**Sum of top 5 ranks**

We see that in only about 2% of the trials did random selection of ranks
produce a total of 17 or lower. RESAMPLING STATS will calculate this for
us directly:

`           COUNT z <= 17 k         `

Determine how many trials produced sums of ranks \<= 17 by chance.

`           DIVIDE k 1000 kk         `

Convert to a proportion.

`           PRINT kk         `

Print the results.

Note: The file "ability1" on the Resampling Stats software disk contains
this set of commands.

Why do we sum the ranks of the first *five* athletes and compare them
with the second five athletes, rather than comparing the top three, say,
with the bottom seven? Indeed, we could have looked at the top three,
two, four, or even six or seven. The first reason for splitting the
group in half is that an even split uses the available information more
fully, and therefore we obtain greater efficiency. (I cannot prove this
formally here, but perhaps it makes intuitive sense to you.) A second
reason is that getting into the habit of always looking at an even split
reduces the chances that you will pick and choose in such a manner as to
fool yourself. For example, if the I.Q. ranks of the top five athletes
were 3, 2, 1, 10, and 9, we would be deceiving ourselves if, after
looking the data over, we drew the line between athletes 3 and 4. (More
generally, choosing an appropriate measure before examining the data
will help you avoid fooling yourself in such matters.)

A simpler but less efficient approach to this same problem is to
classify the top-half athletes by whether or not they were also in the
top half of the I.Q. scores. Of the first five athletes actually
observed, *four* were in the top five I.Q. scores. We can then shuffle
five black and five red cards and see how often four or more (that is,
four or five) blacks come up with the first five cards. The proportion
of times that four or more blacks occurs in the trial is the probability
that an association as strong as that observed might occur by chance
even if there is no association. Table 23-3 shows a proportion of five
trials out of twenty.

In the RESAMPLING STATS program "Ability2" we first note that the top 5
athletes had 4 of the top 5 I.Q. scores. So we constitute the set of 10
IQ rankings (vector A). We then SHUFFLE A and TAKE 5 I.Q. rankings (out
of 10). We COUNT how many are in the top 5, and keep SCORE of the
result. After REPEATing 1000 times, we find out how often we select 4 of
the top 5.

So far we have proceeded on the theory that if there is *any*
relationship between athletics and I.Q., then the better athletes have
higher rather than lower I.Q. scores. The justification for this
assumption is that past research suggests that it is probably true. But
if we had *not* had the benefit of that past research, we would then
have had to proceed somewhat differently; we would have had to consider
the possibility that the top five athletes could have I.Q. scores either
higher *or* lower than those of the other students. The results of the
"two-tail" test would have yielded odds weaker than those we observed.

**Example 23-2: Athletic Ability and I.Q. a Third Way.**

(Program "Ability3").

Example 23-1 investigated the relationship between I.Q. and athletic
score by ranking the two sets of scores. But ranking of scores loses
some efficiency because it uses only an "ordinal" (rank-ordered) rather
than a "cardinal" (measured) scale; the numerical shadings and relative
relationships are lost when we convert to ranks. Therefore let us
consider a test of correlation that uses the original cardinal numerical
scores.

First a little background: Figures 23-1 and 23-2 show two hypothetical
cases of very high association among the I.Q. and athletic scores used
in previous examples. Figure 23-1 indicates that the higher the I.Q.
score, the higher the athletic score. With a boy's athletic score you
can thus predict quite well his I.Q. score by means of a hand-drawn
line — or vice versa. The same is true of Figure 23-2, but in the
opposite direction. Notice that even though athletic score is on the
x-axis (horizontal) and I.Q. score is on the y-axis (vertical), the
athletic score does not *cause* the I.Q. score. (It is an unfortunate
deficiency of such diagrams that *some* variable must arbitrarily be
placed on the x-axis, whether you intend to suggest causation or not.)

In Figure 23-3, which plots the scores as given in table 23-1 the
prediction of athletic score given I.Q. score, or vice versa, is less
clear-cut than in Figure 23-2. On the basis of Figure 23-3 alone, one
can say only that there *might* be some association between the two
variables.

## Correlation: sum of products

Now let us take advantage of a handy property of numbers. The more
closely two sets of numbers match each other in order, the higher the
sums of their products. Consider the following arrays of the numbers 1,
2, and 3:

1 x 1 = 1

2 x 2 = 4 (columns in matching order) 3 x 3 = 9

SUM = 14

1 x 2 = 2

2 x 3 = 6 (columns not in matching order) 3 x 1 = 3

SUM = 11

I will not attempt a mathematical proof, but the reader is encouraged to
try additional combinations to be sure that the highest sum is obtained
when the order of the two columns is the same. Likewise, the lowest sum
is obtained when the two columns are in perfectly opposite order:

1 x 3 = 3

2 x 2 = 4 (columns in opposite order) 3 x 1 = 3

SUM = 10

Consider the cases in Table 23-4 which are chosen to illustrate a
perfect (linear) association between *x* (Column 1) and *y* 1 (Column
2), and also between *x* (Column 1) and *y* 2 (Column 4); the numbers
shown in Columns 3 and 5 are those that would be consistent with perfect
associations. Notice the sum of the multiples of the *x* and *y* values
in the two cases. It is either higher ( *xy* 1) or lower ( *xy* 2) than
for any other possible way of arranging the *y* 's. Any other
arrangement of the *y's* ( *y* 3, in Column 6, for example, chosen at
random), when multiplied by the *x* 's in Column 1, ( *xy* 3), produces
a sum that falls somewhere between the sums of *xy* 1 and *xy* 2, as is
the case with any other set of *y* 3's which is not perfectly correlated
with the *x* 's.

Table 23-5, below, shows that the sum of the products of the *observed*
I.Q. scores multiplied by athletic scores (column 7) is between the sums
that would occur if the I.Q. scores were ranked from best to worst
(column 3) and worst to best (column 5). The extent of correlation
(association) can thus be measured by whether the sum of the multiples
of the observed *x*

and *y* values is relatively much higher or much lower than are sums of
randomly-chosen pairs of *x* and *y* .

Now we attack the I.Q. and athletic-score problem using the property of
numbers just discussed. First multiply the x and y values of the actual
observations, and sum them to be 95,759 (Table 23-5). Then write the ten
observed I.Q. scores on cards, and assign the cards in random order to
the ten athletes, as shown in column 1 in Table 23-6.

Multiply by the x's, and sum as in Table 23-7. If the I.Q. scores and
athletic scores are *positively associated* , that is, if high I.Q.s and
high athletic scores go together, then the sum of the multiplications
for the observed sample will be higher than for most of the random
trials. (If high I.Q.s go with low athletic scores, the sum of the
multiplications for the observed sample will be *lower* than most of the
random trials.)

More specifically, by the steps:

**Step 1.** Write the ten I.Q. scores on one set of cards, and the ten
athletic scores on another set of cards.

**Step 2.** Pair the I.Q. and athletic-score cards at random. Multiply
the scores in each pair, and add the results of the ten multiplications.

**Step 3.** Subtract the experimental sum in step 2 from the observed
sum, 95,759.

**Step 4.** Repeat steps 2 and 3 twenty times.

**Step 5.** Compute the proportion of trials where the difference is
negative, which estimates the probability that an association as strong
as the observed would occur by chance.

The sums of the multiplications for 20 trials are shown in Table 23-7.
No random-trial sum was as high as the observed sum, which suggests that
the probability of an association this strong happening by chance is so
low as to approach zero. (An empirically-observed probability is never
actually zero.)

This program can be solved particularly easily with RESAMPLING STATS.
The arrays A and B in program "Ability3" list the athletic scores and
the I.Q. scores respectively of 10 "actual" students ordered from
highest to lowest athletic score. We MULTIPLY the corresponding elements
of these arrays and proceed to compare the sum of these multiplications
to the sums of experimental multiplications in which the elements are
selected randomly.

Finally, we COUNT the trials in which the sum of the products of the
randomly-paired athletic and I.Q. scores equals or exceeds the sum of
the products in the observed data.

`           NUMBERS (97 94 93 90 87 86 86 85 81 76) a         `

Record athletic scores, highest to lowest.

`           NUMBERS (114 120 107 113 118 101 109 110 100 99) b         `

Record corresponding IQ scores for those students.

`           MULTIPLY a b c         `

Multiply the two sets of scores together.

`           SUM c d         `

Sum the results — the "observed value."

`           REPEAT 1000         `

Do 1000 experiments.

`           SHUFFLE a e         `

Shuffle the athletic scores so we can pair them against IQ scores.

`           MULTIPLY e b f         `

Multiply the shuffled athletic scores by the I.Q. scores. (Note that we
could shuffle the I.Q. scores too but it would not achieve any greater
randomization.)

`           SUM f j         `

Sum the randomized multiplications.

`           SUBTRACT d j k         `

Subtract the sum from the sum of the "observed" multiplication.

`           SCORE k z         `

Keep track of the result in z.

`           END         `

End one trial, go back and repeat until 1000 trials are complete.

`           HISTOGRAM z         `

Obtain a histogram of the trial results.

We see that obtaining a chance trial result as great as that observed
was rare. RESAMPLING STATS will calculate this proportion for us:

`           COUNT z <= 0 k         `

Determine in how many trials the random sum of products was less than
the observed sum of products.

`           DIVIDE k 1000 kk         `

Convert to a proportion.

`           PRINT kk         `

**Example 23-3: Correlation Between Adherence to Medication Regime and
Change in Cholesterol**

Efron and Tibshirani (1993, p.72) show data on the extents to which 164
men a) took the drug prescribed to them (cholostyramine), and b) showed
a decrease in total plasma cholesterol. Table 23-8 shows these values
(note that a positive value in the "decrease in cholesterol" column
denotes a decrease in cholesterol, while a negative value denotes an
increase.)

The aim is to assess the effect of the compliance on the improvement.
There are two related issues:

1.  What form of regression should be fitted to these data, which we
    address later, and

2.  Is there reason to believe that the relationship is meaningful? That
    is, we wish to ascertain if there is any meaningful correlation
    between the variables — because if there is no relationship between
    the variables, there is no basis for regressing one on the other.
    Sometimes people jump ahead in the latter question to first run the
    regression and then ask whether the regression slope coefficient(s)
    is (are) different than zero, but this usually is not sound
    practice. The sensible way to proceed is first to graph the data to
    see whether there is visible indication of a relationship.

Efron and Tibshirani do this, and they find sufficient intuitive basis
in the graph to continue the analysis. The next step is to investigate
whether a measure of relationship is statistically significant; this we
do as follows (program "inp10"):

1.  Multiply the observed values for each of the 164 participants on the
    independent x variable (cholostyramine — percent of prescribed
    dosage actually taken) and the dependent y variable (cholesterol),
    and sum the results — it's 439,140.

2.  Randomly shuffle the dependent variable y values among the
    participants. The sampling is being done without replacement, though
    an equally good argument could be made for sampling with
    replacement; the results do not differ meaningfully, however,
    because the sample size is so large.

3.  Then multiply these x and y hypothetical values for each of the 164
    participants, sum the results and record.

4.  Repeat steps 2 and 3 perhaps 1000 times.

5.  Determine how often the shuffled sum-of-products exceeds the
    observed value (439,140).

The following program in RESAMPLING STATS provides the solution:

`           READ FILE “inp10” x y         `

Data

`           MULTIPLY x y xy         `

Step 1 above

`           SUM xy xysum         `

Note: xysum = 439,140 (4.3914e+05)

`           REPEAT 1000         `

Do 1000 simulations (step 4 above)

`           SHUFFLE x xrandom         `

Step 2 above

`           MULTIPLY xrandom y xy         `

Step 3 above

`           SUM xy newsum         `

Step 3 above

`           SCORE newsum scrboard         `

Step 3 above

`           END         `

Step 4 above

`           COUNT scorboard >=439140 prob         `

Step 5 above

`           PRINT xysum prob         `

Result: prob = 0. Interpretation: 1000 simulated random shufflings never
produced a sum-of-products as high as the observed value. Hence we rule
out random chance as an explanation for the observed correlation.

**Example 23-3: Is There A Relationship Between Drinking Beer And Being
In Favor of Selling Beer?** (Testing for a Relationship Between
Counted-Data Variables.) (Program "Beerpoll")

The data for athletic ability and I.Q. were measured. Therefore, we
could use them in their original "cardinal" form, or we could split them
up into "high" and "low" groups. Often, however, the individual
observations are recorded only as "yes" or "no," which makes it more
difficult to ascertain the existence of a relationship. Consider the
poll responses in Table 23-8 to two public-opinion survey questions: "Do
you drink beer?" and "Are you in favor of local option on the sale of
beer?" \[2\]

Table 23-9

**Results of Observed Sample For Problem "Beerpoll"**

  ---------------------------------------------------- ------------------------ -------- -----------

Here is the statistical question: Is a person's opinion on "local
option" related to whether or not he drinks beer? Our resampling
solution begins by noting that there are seventy-eight respondents,
sixty-five of whom approve local option and thirteen of whom do not.
Therefore write "approve" on sixty-five index cards and "not approve" on
thirteen index cards. Now take *another* set of seventy-eight index
cards, preferably of a different color, and write "yes" on fifty-two of
them and "no" on twenty-six of them, corresponding to the numbers of
people who do and do not drink beer in the sample. Now lay them down in
random *pairs* , one from each pile.

If there is a high association between the variables, then real life
observations will bunch up in the two diagonal cells in the upper left
and lower right in Table 23-8. (Ignore the "total" data for now.)
Therefore, subtract one sum of two diagonal cells from the other sum for
the observed data: (45 + 6) - (20 + 7) = 24. Then compare this
difference to the comparable differences found in random trials. The
proportion of times that the simulated-trial difference exceeds the
observed difference is the probability that the observed difference of
+24 might occur by chance, even if there is no relationship between the
two variables. (Notice that, in this case, we are working on the
assumption that beer drinking is *positively* associated with approval
of local option and not the inverse. We are interested only in
differences that are equal to or exceed +24 when the northeast-southwest
diagonal is subtracted from the northwest-southeast diagonal.)

We can carry out a resampling test with this procedure:

**Step 1.** Write "approve" on 65 and "disapprove" on 13 red index
cards, respectively; write "Drink" and "Don't drink" on 52 and 26 white
cards, respectively.

**Step 2.** Pair the two sets of cards randomly. Count the numbers of
the four possible pairs: (1) "approve-drink," (2) "disapprove-don't
drink," (3) "disapprove-drink," and (4) "approve-don't drink." Record
the number of these combinations, as in Table 23-10, where columns 1-4
correspond to the four cells in Table 23-9.

**Step 3.** Add (column 1 plus column 4) and (column 2 plus column 3),
and subtract the result in the second parenthesis from the result in the
first parenthesis. If the difference is equal to or greater than 24,
record "yes," otherwise "no."

**Step 4.** Repeat steps 2 and 3 perhaps a hundred times.

**Step 5.** Calculate the proportion "yes," which estimates the
probability that an association this great or greater would be observed
by chance.

A series of ten trials in this case (see Table 23-9) indicates that the
observed difference is very often exceeded, which suggests that there is
no relationship between beer drinking and opinion.

The RESAMPLING STATS program "Beerpoll" does this repetitively. From the
"actual" sample results we know that 52 respondents drink beer and 26 do
not. We create the vector "drink" with 52 "1"s for those who drink beer,
and 26 "2"s for those who do not. We also create the vector "sale" with
65 "1"s (approve) and 13 "2"s (disapprove). In the actual sample, 51 of
the 78 respondents had "consistent" responses to the two
questions — that is, people who both favor the sale of beer *and* drink
beer, or who are against the sale of beer *and* do not drink beer. We
want to randomly pair the responses to the two questions to compare
against that observed result to test the relationship.

To accomplish this aim, we REPEAT the following procedure 1000 times. We
SHUFFLE drink to drink\$ so that the responses are randomly ordered. Now
when we SUBTRACT the corresponding elements of the two arrays, a "0"
will appear in each element of the new array c for which there was
consistency in the response of the two questions. We therefore COUNT the
times that c equals "0" and place this result in d, and the number of
times c does not equal 0, and place this result in e. Find the
difference (d minus e), and SCORE this to z.

SCORE Z stores for each trial the number of consistent responses minus
inconsistent responses. To determine whether the results of the actual
sample indicate a relationship between the responses to the two
questions, we check how often the random trials had a difference
(between consistent and inconsistent responses) as great as 24, the
value in the observed sample.

`           URN 52#1 26#0 drink         `

Constitute the set of 52 beer drinkers, represented by 52 "1"s, and the
set of 26 non-drinkers, represented by "2"s.

`           URN 57#1 21#0 sale         `

The same set of individuals classified by whether they favor ("1") or
don't favor ("0") the sale of beer.

Note: F is now the vector {1 1 1 1 1 1 \... 0 0 0 0 0 \...} where 1 =
people in favor, 0 = people opposed.

`           REPEAT 1000         `

Repeat the experiment 1000 times.

`           SHUFFLE drink drink$         `

Shuffle the beer drinkers/non-drinker, call the shuffled set drink\*.

Note: drink\$ is now a vector like {1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 \...}
where 1 = drinker, 0 = non-drinker.

`           END         `

`           SUBTRACT drink$ sale c         `

Subtract the favor/don't favor set from the drink/don't drink set.
Consistent responses are someone who drinks favoring the sale of beer (a
"1" and a "1") or someone who doesn't drink opposing the sale of beer.
When subtracted, consistent responses *(and only consistent responses)*
produce a "0."

`           COUNT c =0 d         `

Count the number of consistent responses (those equal to "0").

`           COUNT c <> 0 e         `

Count the "inconsistent" responses (those not equal to "0").

`           SUBTRACT d e f         `

Find the difference

`           SCORE f z         `

Keep track of the results of each trial.

End one trial, go back and repeat until all 1000 trials are complete.

`           HISTOGRAM z         `

Produce a histogram of the trial result.

Note: The file "beerpoll" on the Resampling Stats software disk contains
this set of commands.

**Are Drinkers More Likely to Favor Local Option & Vice Versa**

![](images/27-Chap-23_005.png)

**\# consistent responses thru chance draw**

The actual results showed a difference of 24. In the histogram we see
that a difference that large or larger happened just by chance
pairing — without any relationship between the two variables — 23% of
the time. Hence, we conclude that there is little evidence of a
relationship between the two variables.

Though the test just described may *generally* be appropriate for data
of this sort, it may well not be appropriate in some particular case.
Let's consider a set of data where even if the test showed that an
association existed, we would not believe the test result to be
meaningful.

Suppose the survey results had been as presented in Table 23-11. We see
that non-beer drinkers have a higher rate of approval of allowing beer
drinking, which does not accord with experience or reason. Hence,
without additional explanation we would not believe that a meaningful
relationship exists among these variables even if the test showed one to
exist. (Still another reason to doubt that a relationship exists is that
the absolute differences are too small — there is only a 6% difference
in disapproval between drink and don't drink groups — to mean anything
to anyone. On both grounds, then, it makes sense simply to act as if
there were no difference between the two groups and to run *no test* .).

Table 23-11

**Beer Poll In Which Results Are Not In Accord With Expectation Or
Reason**

  ------------------- --------------- ------------------ -----------
                      **% Approve**   **% Disapprove**   **Total**
  Beer Drinkers       71%             29%                100%
  Non-Beer Drinkers   77%             23%                100%
  ------------------- --------------- ------------------ -----------

The lesson to be learned from this is that one should inspect the data
carefully before applying a statistical test, and only test for
"significance" if the apparent relationships accord with theory, general
understanding, and common sense.

**Example 23-4: Do Athletes Really Have "Slumps"?** (Are Successive
Events in a Series Independent, or is There a Relationship Between
Them?)

The important concept of independent events was introduced earlier.
Various scientific and statistical decisions depend upon whether or not
a series of events is independent. But how does one know whether or not
the events are independent? Let us consider a baseball example.

Baseball players and their coaches believe that on some days and during
some weeks a player will bat better than on other days and during other
weeks. And team managers and coaches act on the belief that there are
periods in which players do poorly — slumps — by temporarily replacing
the player with another after a period of poor performance. The
underlying belief is that a series of failures indicates a temporary (or
permanent) change in the player's capacity to play well, and it
therefore makes sense to replace him until the evil spirit passes on,
either of its own accord or by some change in the player's style.

But even if his hits come randomly, a player will have runs of good luck
and runs of bad luck just by chance — just as does a card player. The
problem, then, is to determine whether (a) the runs of good and bad
batting are merely runs of chance, and the probability of success for
each event remains the same throughout the series of events — which
would imply that the batter's ability is the same at all times, and
coaches should not take recent performance heavily into account when
deciding which players should play; or (b) whether a batter really does
have a tendency to do better at some times than at others, which would
imply that there is some relationship between the occurrence of success
in one trial event and the probability of success in the next trial
event, and therefore that it is reasonable to replace players from time
to time.

Let's analyze the batting of a player we shall call "Slug." Here are the
results of Slug's first 100 times at bat during the 1987 season ("H" =
hit, "X" = out):

X X X X X X H X X H X H H X X X X X X X X H X X X X X H X X X X H H X X
X X X H X X H X H X X X H H X X X X X H X H X X X X H H X H H X X X X X
X X X X X H X X X H X X H X X H X H X X H X X X H X X X.

Now, do Slug's hits tend to come in bunches? That would be the case if
he really did have a tendency to do better at some times than at others.
Therefore, let us compare Slug's results with those of a deck of cards
or a set of random numbers that we know has no tendency to do better at
some times than at others.

During this period of 100 times at bat, Slug has averaged one hit in
every four times at bat — a .250 batting average. This average is the
same as the chance of one card suit's coming up. We designate hearts as
"hits" and prepare a deck of 100 cards, twenty-five "H"s (hearts, or
"hit") and seventy-five "X"s (other suit, or "out"). Here is the
sequence in which the 100 randomly-shuffled cards fell:

X X H X X X X H H X X X H H H X X X X X H X X X H X X H X X X X H X H H
X X X X X X X X X H X X X X X X H H X X X X X H H H X X X X X X H X H X
H X X H X H X X X X X X X X X H X X X X X X X H H H X X.

Now we can compare whether or not Slug's hits are bunched up more than
they would be by random chance; we can do so by *counting the clusters*
(also called "runs") of consecutive hits and outs for Slug and for the
cards. Slug had forty-three clusters, which is more than the
thirty-seven clusters in the cards; it therefore does not seem that
there is a tendency for Slug's hits to cluster together. (A larger
number of clusters indicates a lower tendency to cluster.)

Of course, the single trial of 100 cards shown above might have an
unusually high or low number of clusters. To be safer, lay out, (say,)
ten trials of 100 cards each, and compare Slug's number of clusters with
the various trials. The proportion of trials with more clusters than
Slug's indicates whether or not Slug's hits have a tendency to bunch up.
(But caution: This proportion cannot be interpreted directly as a
probability.)

Now the steps:

**Step 1.** Constitute a bucket with 3 slips of paper that say "out" and
one that says "hit." Or "01-25" = hits (H), "26-00" = outs (X), Slug's
long-run average.

**Step 2.** Sample 100 slips of paper, with replacement, record "hit" or
"out" each time, or write a series of "H's" or "X's" corresponding to
100 numbers, each selected randomly between 1 and 100.

**Step 3.** Count the number of "clusters," that is, the number of
"runs" of the same event, "H"s or "X"s.

**Step 4.** Compare the outcome in step 3 with Slug's outcome, 43
clusters. If 43 or fewer; write "yes," otherwise "no."

**Step 5.** Repeat steps 2-4 a hundred times.

**Step 6.** Compute the proportion "yes." This estimates the probability
that Slug's record is not characterized by more "slumps" than would be
caused by chance. A very low proportion of "yeses" indicates longer (and
hence fewer) "streaks" and "slumps" than would result by chance.

In RESAMPLING STATS, we can do this experiment 1000 times.

`           REPEAT 1000         `

`           URN 3#0 1#1 a SAMPLE 100 a b         `

Sample 100 "at-bats" from a

`           RUNS b >=1 c         `

How many runs (of any length \>=1) are there in the 100 at-bats?

`           SCORE c z         `

`           END HISTOGRAM z         `

Note: The file "sluggo" on the Resampling Stats software disk contains
this set of commands.

Examining the histogram, we see that 43 runs is not at all an unusual
occurrence:

**"Runs" in 100 At-Bats**

![](images/27-Chap-23_006.png)

**\# "runs" of same outcome**

The manager wants to look at this matter in a somewhat different
fashion, however. He insists that the existence of slumps is proven by
the fact that the player sometimes does not get a hit for an abnormally
long period of time. One way of testing whether or not the coach is
right is by comparing an average player's longest slump in a 100-at-bat
season with the longest run of outs in the first card trial. Assume that
Slug is a player picked *at random* . Then compare Slug's longest
slump — say, 10 outs in a row — with the longest cluster of a single
simulated 100-at-bat trial with the cards, 9 outs. This result suggests
that Slug's apparent slump might well have resulted by chance.

The estimate can be made more accurate by taking the *average* longest
slump (cluster of outs) in ten simulated 400-at-bat trials. But notice
that we do *not* compare Slug's slump against the *longest* slump found
in ten such simulated trials. We want to know the longest cluster of
outs that would be found under *average* conditions, and the hand with
the *longest* slump is *not* average or typical. Determining whether to
compare Slug's slump with the *average* longest slump or with the
*longest* of the ten longest slumps is a decision of crucial importance.
There are no mathematical or logical rules to help you. What is required
is hard, clear thinking. Experience can help you think clearly, of
course, but these decisions are not easy or obvious even to the most
experienced statisticians.

The coach may then refer to the protracted slump of one of the
twenty-five players on his team to prove that slumps really occur. But,
of twenty-five random 100-at-bat trials, one will contain a slump longer
than any of the other twenty-four, and that slump will be considerably
longer than average. A fair comparison, then, would be between the
longest slump of his longest-slumping player, and the longest run of
outs found among twenty-five random trials. In fact, the longest run
among twenty-five hands of 100 cards was fifteen outs in a row. And, if
we had set some of the hands for lower (and higher) batting averages
than .250, the longest slump in the cards would have been even longer.

Research by Roberts and his students at the University of Chicago shows
that in fact slumps do *not* exist, as I conjectured in the first
publication of this material in 1969. (Of course, a batter feels as if
he has a better chance of getting a hit at some times than at other
times. After a series of successful at-bats, sandlot players and
professionals alike feel confident — just as gamblers often feel that
they're on a "streak." But there seems to be no connection between a
player's performance and whether he feels hot or cold, astonishing as
that may be.)

Averages over longer periods may vary systematically, as Ty Cobb's
annual batting average varied non-randomly from season to season,
Roberts found. But short-run analyses of dayto-day and week-to-week
individual and team performances in most sports have shown results
similar to the outcomes that a lottery-type random-number machine would
produce.

Remember, too, the study by Gilovich, Vallone, and Twersky of basketball
mentioned in Chapter 9. To repeat, their analyses "provided no evidence
for a positive correlation between the outcomes of successive shots."
That is, knowing whether a shooter has or has not scored on the previous
sheet — or in any previous sequence of shots — is useless for predicting
whether he will score again.

The species homo sapiens apparently has a powerful propensity to believe
that one can find a pattern even when there is no pattern to be found.
Two decades ago I cooked up several series of random numbers that looked
like weekly prices of publicly-traded stocks. Players in the experiment
were told to buy and sell stocks as they chose. Then I repeatedly gave
them "another week's prices," and allowed them to buy and sell again.
The players did all kinds of fancy calculating, using a wild variety of
assumptions — although there was no possible way that the figuring could
help them.

When I stopped the game before completing the 10 buy-andsell sessions
they expected, subjects would ask that the game go on. Then I would tell
them that there was no basis to believe that there were patterns in the
data, because the "prices" were just randomly-generated numbers. Winning
or losing therefore did not depend upon the subjects' skill.
Nevertheless, they demanded that the game not stop until the 10 "weeks"
had been played, so they could find out whether they "won" or "lost."

This study of batting illustrates how one can test for independence
among various trials. The trials are independent if each observation is
randomly chosen with replacement from the universe, in which case there
is no reason to believe that one observation will be related to the
observations directly before and after; as it is said, "the coin has no
memory."

The year-to-year level of Lake Michigan is an example in which
observations are *not* independent. If Lake Michigan is very high in one
year, it is likely to be higher than average the following year because
some of the high level carries over from one year into the next. \[3\]
We could test this hypothesis by writing down whether the level in each
year from, say, 1860 to 1975 was higher or lower than the median level
for those years. We would then count the number of runs of "higher" and
"lower" and compare the number of runs of "black" and "red" with a deck
of that many cards; we would find fewer runs in the lake level than in
an average hand of 116 (1976-1860) cards, though this test is hardly
necessary. (But are the *changes* in Lake Michigan's level independent
from year to year? If the level went up last year, is there a better
than 50-50 chance that the level will also go up this year? The answer
to this question is not so obvious. One could compare the numbers of
runs of ups and downs against an average hand of cards, just as with the
hits and outs in baseball.)

Exercise for students: How could one check whether the successive
numbers in a random-number table are independent?

**Exercise 23-2**

We would like to know whether, among major-league baseball players, home
runs (per 500 at-bats) and strikeouts (per 500 at-bat's) are correlated.
We first use the procedure as used above for I.Q. and athletic
ability — multiplying the elements within each pair. (We will later use
a more "sophisticated" measure, the correlation coefficient.)

The data for 18 randomly-selected players in the 1989 season are as
follows, as they would appear in the first lines of the program.

`           NUMBERS (14 20 0 38 9 38 22 31 33 11 40 5 15 32 3 29 5 32)         `

Exercise: Complete this program.

**Exercise 23-3**

In the previous example relating strikeouts and home runs, we used the
procedure of multiplying the elements within each pair. Now we use a
more "sophisticated" measure, the correlation coefficient, which is
simply a standardized form of the multiplicands, but sufficiently well
known that we calculate it with a pre-set command.

Exercise: Write a program that uses the correlation coefficient to test
the significance of the association between home runs and strikeouts.

 Percentage changes in exchange rates and money supply between 1983 and
1984 for various countries.

Are changes in the exchange rates and in money supplies related to each
other? That is, are they correlated? (adapted from Noreen, 1990)

Exercise: Should the algorithm of non-computer resampling steps be
similar to the algorithm for I.Q. and athletic ability shown in the
text? One can also work with the correlation coefficient rather then the
sum-of-products method, and expect to get the same result.

1.  Write a series of non-computer resampling steps to solve this
    problem.

2.  Write a computer program to implement those steps.
