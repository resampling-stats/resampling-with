# Probability Theory, Part 4: Estimating Probabilities from Finite Universes

## Introduction

The examples in Chapter 7 dealt with *infinite universes* , in which the
probability of a given simple event is unaffected by the outcome of the
previous simple event. But now we move on to finite universes,
situations in which you begin with a *given set of objects* whose number
is not enormous — say, a total of two, or two hundred, or two thousand.
If we liken such a situation to a bucket containing balls of different
colors each with a number on it, we are interested in the probability of
drawing various sets of numbered and colored balls from the bucket on the
condition that we *do not replace* balls after they are drawn.

In the cases addressed in this chapter, it is important to remember that
the single events no longer are independent of each other. A typical
situation in which sampling without replacement occurs is when items are
chosen from a finite universe--- for example, when children are selected
randomly from a classroom. If the class has five boys and five girls,
and if you were to choose three girls in a row, then the chance of
selecting a fourth girl on the next choice obviously is lower than the
chance that you would pick a girl on the first selection.

The key to dealing with this type of problem is the same as with earlier
problems: You must choose a simulation procedure that produces simple
events having the same probabilities as the simple events in the actual
problem involving sampling without replacement. That is, you must make
sure that your simulation does not allow duplication of events that have
already occurred. The easiest way to sample without replace-

ment with resampling techniques is by simply ignoring an outcome if it
has already occurred.

Examples 8-1 through 8-10 deal with some of the more important sorts of
questions one may ask about drawings without replacement from such an
urn. To get an overview, I suggest that you read over the titles of
Examples 8-1 to 8-10 before beginning to work through the examples
themselves.

This chapter also revisits the general procedure used in solving
problems in probability and statistics with simulation, here in
connection with problems involving a finite universe. The steps that one
follows in simulating the behavior of a universe of interest are set
down in such fashion that one may, by random drawings, deduce the
probability of various events. Having had by now the experience of
working through the problems in Chapters 5 and 7, the reader should have
a solid basis to follow the description of the general procedure which
then helps in dealing with specific problems.

Let us begin by describing some of the major sorts of problems with the
aid of a bucket with six balls.

## Some building-block programs

**Case 1.** Each of six balls is labeled with a number between "1" and
"6." We ask: What is the probability of choosing balls 1, 2, and 3 *in
that order* if we choose three balls without replacement? Figure 8-1
diagrams the events we consider "success."

**Case 2.** We begin with the same bucket as in Case 1, but now ask the
probability of choosing balls 1, 2, and 3 *in any order* if we choose
three balls without replacement. Figure 8-2 diagrams two of the events
we consider success. These possibilities include that which is shown in
Figure 8-1 above, plus other possibilities.

**Case 3.** The odd-numbered balls "1," "3," and "5," are painted red
and the even-numbered balls "2," "4," and "6" are painted black. What is
the probability of getting a red ball and then a black ball in that
order? Some possibilities are illustrated in Figure 8-3, which includes
the possibility shown in Figure 8-1. It also includes *some but not* all
possibilities found in Figure 8-2; for example, Figure 8-2 includes
choosing balls 2, 3 and 1 in that order, but Figure 8-3 does not.

on the first draw *or* ball 2 on the second draw *or* ball 3 on the
third draw? (Figure 8-5) Or, what is the probability of getting all
balls on the draws corresponding to their numbers?

## Problems in finite universes

## Example 8-1: What is the Probability of Selecting Four Girls and One Boy When Selecting Five Students From Any Group of Twenty-five Girls and Twenty-five Boys? (Sampling Without Replacement When There are Two Outcomes and the Order Does Not Matter)

The important difference between this example and the infinite-universe
examples in the prior chapter is that the probability of obtaining a boy
or a girl in a single simple event *differs* from one event to the next
in this example, whereas it stays the same when the sampling is with
replacement. To illustrate, the probability of a girl is .5 (25 out of
50) when the first student is chosen, but the probability of a girl is
either 25/49 or 24/49 when the second student is chosen, depending on
whether a boy or a girl was chosen on the first pick. Or after, say,
three girls and one boy are picked, the probability of getting a girl on
the next choice is (28-3)/(50-4) = 22/46 which is clearly not equal to
.5.

As always, we must create a satisfactory analog to the process whose
probability we want to learn. In this case, we can use a deck of 50
cards, half red and half black, and deal out five cards *without
replacing them* after each card is dealt; this simulates the choice of
five students from among the fifty.

We can no longer use our procedure from before.  If we designated
"1-25" as being girls and "26-50" as being boys and then proceeded to
draw random numbers, the probability of a girl would be the same on
each pick.

At this point, it is important to note that — for this particular
problem — we do not need to distinguish between particular girls (or
boys). That is, it does not matter *which* girl (or boy) is selected
in a given trial. Nor did we pay attention to the *order* in which we
selected girls or boys. This is an instance of Case 4 discussed
above. Subsequent problems will deal with situations where the order
of selection, and the particular individuals, do matter.

Our approach then is to mimic having the class in front of us: an
array of 50 strings, half of the entries 'boy' and the other half
'girl'.  We then shuffle the class (the array), and choose the first N
students (strings).

**Step 1.** Create a list with 50 labels, half 'boy' and half 'girl'.

**Step 2.** Shuffle the class and select five students. Count whether
  there are four labels equal 'girl'. If so, write "yes," otherwise
  "no".

**Step 3.** Repeat step 2, say, 10,000 times, and count the proportion
  "yes", which estimates the probability sought.

The results of a few experimental trials are shown in Table 8-1.

+----------------+---------------------------------------+---------------+

A solution to this problem with {{< var lang >}} is presented below.

```{python, opts.label="py_ed"}
import numpy as np
```

```{python, opts.label="py_ed"}
N = 10000
trial_results = np.zeros(N)

# Constitute the set of 25 girls and 25 boys.
whole_class = np.repeat(['girl', 'boy'], [25, 25])

# Repeat the following steps N times.
for i in range(N):

    # Shuffle the numbers
    np.random.shuffle(whole_class)

    # Take the first 5 numbers, call them c.
    c = whole_class[:5]

    # Count how many girls there are, put the result in d.
    d = np.count_nonzero(c == 'girl')

    # Keep track of each trial result in z.
    trial_results[i] = d

    # End the experiment, go back and repeat until all 1000 trials are
    # complete.

# Count the number of times we got four girls, put the result in k.
k = np.count_nonzero(trial_results == 4)

# Convert to a proportion.
kk = k / N

# Print the result.
print(kk)
```

We can also find the probabilities of other outcomes from a histogram of
trial results obtained with the following command:

```{python, opts.label="py_ed"}
# Import the plotting package.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# Turn on interactive plotting
plt.ion()
# Do histogram, with one bin for each possible number.
plt.hist(trial_results, bins=range(7), align='left', density=True, rwidth=0.75)
plt.title('# of girls');
```

In the resulting histogram we can see that in 14 percent of the trials,
4 of the 5 selected were girls.

It should be noted that for this problem — as for most other
problems — there are several other resampling procedures that will also
do the job correctly.

In analytic probability theory this problem is worked with a formula for
"combinations."


## Example 8-2: Nine Spades and Four Clubs in a Bridge Hand (Multiple-Outcome Sampling Without Replacement, Order Does not Matter)

This problem is similar to Example 8-1 except that now there are four
equally-likely outcomes instead of only two.
[A Python]{.python}[An R]{.r} solution is:

```{python, opts.label="py_ed"}
# Constitute the deck of 52 cards.
# Make a 4 element array of strings, with the suit names.
suits = np.array(['spade', 'clubs', 'diamonds', 'hearts'])
# Repeat the suit names 13 times each, to make a 52 card deck.
deck = np.repeat(suits, 13)
# Show the deck
deck
```

```{python, opts.label="py_ed"}
N = 10000
trial_results = np.zeros(N)

# Repeat the trial N times.
for i in range(N):

    # Shuffle the deck and draw 13 cards
    hand = np.random.choice(deck, 13, replace=False)

    # Count the number of spades in "hand", put the result in "n_spades".
    n_spades = np.count_nonzero(hand == 'spade')

    # If we have nine spades, we'll continue on to count the clubs. If we don't
    # have nine spades, the number of clubs is irrelevant — we have not gotten
    # the hand we are interested in.
    if n_spades == 9:

        # Count the clubs, put the result in "n_clubs"
        n_clubs = np.count_nonzero(hand == 'club')
        # Keep track of the number of clubs in each trial
        trial_results[i] = n_clubs

    # End one experiment, go back and repeat until all N trials are done.

# Count the number of trials where we got 4 clubs. This is the answer we want -
# the number of hands out of 1000 with 9 spades and 4 clubs. (Recall that we
# only counted the clubs if the hand already had 9 spades.)
n_9_and_4 = np.count_nonzero(trial_results == 4)

# Convert to a proportion.
prop_9_and_4 = n_9_and_4 / N

# Print the result
print(prop_9_and_4)
```

```{python, opts.label="py_ed"}
hand
```

## Example 8-3: A Total of Fifteen Points in a Bridge Hand When Ace = 4, King = 3, Queen = 2, and Jack = 1.

This problem bears the same relationship to Example 8-2 that Example 4-5
bears to Example 4-4.

```{python, opts.label="py_ed"}
# Constitute a deck with 4 jacks (point value 1), 4 queens (value 2), 4
# kings (value 3), 4 aces (value 4), and 36 other cards with no point
# value
whole_deck = np.repeat([1, 2, 3, 4, 0], [4, 4, 4, 4, 36])
whole_deck
```

```{python, opts.label="py_ed"}
N = 10000
trial_results = np.zeros(N, dtype=int)

# Do N trials.
for i in range(N):
    # Shuffle the deck of cards and draw 13
    hand = np.random.choice(whole_deck, 13, replace=False)

    # Total the points.
    points = np.sum(hand)

    # Keep score of the result.
    trial_results[i] = points

    # End one experiment, go back and repeat until all N trials are done.
```

```{python, opts.label="py_ed"}
# Produce a histogram of trial results.
plt.hist(trial_results, bins=range(25), align='left', density=True, rwidth=0.75)
plt.title('Points in bridge hands');
```

From this histogram, we see that in about 5 percent of our trials we obtained a
total of exactly 15 points. We can also compute this directly:

```{python, opts.label="py_ed"}
# How many times did we have a hand with fifteen points?
k = np.count_nonzero(trial_results == 15)

# Convert to a proportion.
kk = k / N

# Print the result.
print(kk)
```

## Example 8-4: Four Girls and Then One Boy From Twenty-five Girls and Twenty-five Boys Order Matters, Sampling Without Replacement, Two Outcomes, Several of Each Item

What is the probability of getting an ordered series of *four girls and
then one boy* , from a universe of twenty-five girls and twenty-five
boys? This illustrates Case 3 above. Clearly we can use the same
sampling mechanism as in Example 8-1, but now we record "yes" for a
smaller number of composite events.

We record "no" if only one boy is chosen but he is chosen 1st, 2nd, 3rd,
or 4th, whereas in Example 8-1 such outcomes are recorded as "yes"-es.

**Step 1.** Generate a class (array) of length 50, consisting of 25
  strings valued "boy" and 25 strings valued "girl".

**Step 2.** Shuffle the class array, and select the first five
  elements. If those are `['girl', 'girl', 'girl', 'girl', 'boy']`,
  write "yes," otherwise "no."

**Step 3.** Repeat step 2, say, 10,000 times, and count the proportion
  "yes" which estimates the probability sought.

```{python, opts.label="py_ed"}
N = 10000
trial_results = np.zeros(N, dtype=bool)

# Constitute the set of 25 girls and 25 boys.
whole_class = np.repeat(['girl', 'boy'], [25, 25])

# Repeat the following steps 1000 times.
for i in range(N):

    # Shuffle the numbers
    np.random.shuffle(whole_class)

    # Take the first 5 numbers, call them c.
    c = whole_class[:5]

    four_girls_then_one_boy = (
        np.all(c == ['girl', 'girl', 'girl', 'girl', 'boy'])
    )

    # Or:
    #
    #
    # four_girls_then_one_boy = (
    #   np.all(c[:4] == 'girl') and c[4] == 'boy'
    # )

    trial_results[i] = four_girls_then_one_boy

    # End the experiment, go back and repeat until all N trials are
    # complete.

# Count the number of times we got four girls then a boy
k = np.count_nonzero(trial_results)

# Convert to a proportion.
kk = k / N

# Print the result.
print(kk)
```

This type of problem is conventionally done with a *permutation*
formula.

## Example 8-5: Four or More Couples Getting Their Own Partners When Ten Couples are Paired Randomly (Probability of Matching by Chance)

Ten representatives each from two universities, Birmingham and
Berkeley, attend a meeting.  As a social icebreaker, representatives
are divided, randomly, into pairs consisting of one person from each
university.

If they held a second round of the icebreaker, again with random
pairing, what is the chance that four or more pairs will be the same?

In approaching this problem, we start at the point where the first
icebreaker is complete.  We now have to determine what happens after
the second round.

**Step 1.** Let "ace" through "10" of hearts represent the ten
  students from Birmingham University.  Let "ace" through "10" of
  spades be their allocated partners (in round one) from Berkeley.

**Step 2.** Shuffle the hearts and deal them out in a row; shuffle the
  spades and deal in a row just below the hearts.

**Step 3.** Count the pairs — a pair is one card from the heart row and
  one card from the spade row — that contain the same denomination. If 4
  or more pairs match, record "yes," otherwise "no."

**Step 4.** Repeat steps (2) and (3), say, 10,000 times.

**Step 5.** Count the proportion "yes." This estimates the probability
of 4 or more pairs.

Exercise for the student: Write the steps to do this example with random
numbers.  The solution follows below.

```{python, opts.label="py_ed"}
N = 10000
trial_results = np.zeros(N, dtype=int)

# Assign numbers to each student, according to their pair, after the first
# icebreaker
birmingham = np.arange(10)
berkeley = np.arange(10)

for i in range(N):
    # Randomly shuffle the students from Berkeley
    shuffled_berkeley = np.random.permutation(berkeley)

    # Randomly shuffle the students from Birmingham
    # (This step is not really necessary — shuffling one array is enough to make the matching random.)
    shuffled_birmingham = np.random.permutation(birmingham)

    # Count in how many cases people landed with the same person as in the
    # first round, and store in trial_results.
    matches = np.count_nonzero(shuffled_berkeley == shuffled_birmingham)
    trial_results[i] = matches

# Count the number of times we got 4 or more people assigned to the same person
k = np.count_nonzero(trial_results >= 4)

# Convert to a proportion.
kk = k / N

# Print the result.
print(kk)
```

We see that in about 3 percent of the trials did 4 or more couples end
up being re-paired with their own partners.  This can also be seen
from the histogram:

```{python, opts.label="py_ed"}
# Produce a histogram of trial results.
plt.hist(trial_results, bins=range(10), align='left', density=True, rwidth=0.75)
plt.title('Same pairs in round two');
```

## Example 8-6: Matching Santa Hats: Another famous problem of this sort: The hat-checker at a restaurant mixes up the hats of a party of 6. What is the probability that at least one will get his own hat?

After a long Christmas day, six Santas meet in the pub to let off
steam. However, as luck would have it, their hats are mixed up by the
host. When the hats are returned, what is the chance that at least one
Santa will get his own hat back?

First, assign each of the 6 Santas a number, and place these numbers
in an array. Next, shuffle the array (this represents the mixed-up
hats) and compare to the original. The rest of the problem is the same
as the pairs one from before, except that we are now interested in any
trial where at least one (\>= 1) Santa received the right hat.

```{python, opts.label="py_ed"}
N = 10000
trial_results = np.zeros(N, dtype=bool)

# Assign numbers to each owner
owners = np.arange(6)

# Each hat gets the number of their owner
hats = np.arange(6)

for i in range(N):
    # Randomly shuffle the hats and compare to their owners
    shuffled_hats = np.random.permutation(hats)

    # In how many cases did at least one person get their hat back?
    trial_results[i] = np.any(shuffled_hats == owners)

# How many times, over all trials, did at least one person get their hat back?
k = np.count_nonzero(trial_results)

# Convert to a proportion.
kk = k / N

# Print the result.
print(kk)
```

We see that in roughly 62 percent of the trials at least one
person received their own hat back.

## Example 8-7: Twenty executives are to be assigned to two divisions of a firm

The top manager wants to spread the talent reasonably evenly, but she
does not want to label particular executives with a quality rating and
therefore considers distributing them with a random selection. She
therefore wonders: What are probabilities of the best ten among the
twenty being split among the divisions in the ratios 5 and 5, 4 and 6, 3
and 7, etc. if their names are drawn from a hat? One might imagine much
the same sort of problem in choosing two teams for a football or
baseball contest.

One may proceed as follows:

1.  Put 10 balls labeled "W" (for "worst") and 10 balls labeled "B"
    (best) in a bucket.

2.  Draw 10 balls without replacement and count the W's.

3.  Repeat (say) 400 times.

4.  Count the number of times each split — 5 W's and 5 B's, 4 and 6,
    etc.---appears in the results.

    The problem can be done with RESAMPLING STATS as follows:

    `               URN 10#1 10#2 a             `

    `               REPEAT 1000             `

    `               SHUFFLE a b TAKE b 1,10 c COUNT c =1 d SCORE d z             `

    `               END HISTOGRAM z             `

    ![](images/12-Chap-8_009.png)

```{python, opts.label="py_ed"}
N = 10000
trial_results = np.zeros(N, dtype=int)

# 10 zeros for worst managers, 10 ones for best managers.
managers = np.repeat([0, 1], [10, 10])

for i in range(N):
    chosen = np.random.choice(managers, 10, replace=False)
    trial_results[i] = np.sum(chosen)

plt.hist(trial_results, bins=range(10), align='left', density=True, rwidth=0.75)
plt.title('Number of good managers chosen')
```

## Example 8-8: Executives Moving

**NOTE:** Same as couples example?

A major retail chain moves its store managers from city to city
every three years in order to calculate individuals' knowledge and
experience. To make the procedure seem fair, the new locations are
drawn at random. Nevertheless, the movement is not popular with
managers' families. Therefore, to make the system a bit sporting and
to give people some hope of remaining in the same location, the
chain allows managers to draw in the lottery the same posts they are
now in. What are the probabilities that 1, 2, 3\... will get their
present posts again if the number of managers is 30?

The problem can be solved with the following steps:

1.  Number a set of green balls from "1" to "30" and put them into
    Bucket A randomly. Number a set of red balls from "1" to "30" and
    then put into Bucket B. For greater concreteness one could use 30
    little numbered dolls in Bucket A and 30 little toy houses in
    Bucket B.

2.  Shuffle Bucket A, and array all its green balls into a row (vector
    A). Array all the red balls from Bucket B into a second row B just
    below row A.

3.  Count how many green balls in row A have the same numbers as the
    red balls just below them, and record that number on a
    scoreboard.

4.  Repeat steps 2 and 3 perhaps 1000 times. Then count in the
    scoreboard the numbers of "0," "1," "2," "3."

## Example 8-9: State Liquor Systems Again

Let's end this chapter with the example of state liquor systems that was
examined in the previous chapter and which will be discussed again later
in the context of problems in statistics.

Remember that as of 1963, there were 26 U.S. states in whose liquor
systems the retail liquor stores are privately owned, and 16 "monopoly"
states where the state government owns the retail liquor stores. These
were the 1961 prices:

**16 monopoly states:** \$4.65, \$4.55, \$4.11, \$4.15, \$4.20, \$4.55,
\$3.80,

\$4.00, \$4.19, \$4.75, \$4.74, \$4.50, \$4.10, \$4.00, \$5.05, \$4.20

Let us now consider that all these states' prices constitute one single
*finite* universe. We ask: If these 42 states constitute a universe, and
if they are all shuffled together, how likely is it that if one divides
them into two samples at random (sampling without replacement),
containing 16 and 26 observations respectively, the difference in mean
prices turns out to be as great as \$.49 (the difference that was
actually observed)?

Again we write each of the forty-two observed state prices on a separate
card. The shuffled deck simulates a situation in which each state has an
equal chance for each price. Repeatedly deal groups of 16 and 26 cards,
*without replacing* the cards as they are chosen, to simulate
hypothetical monopoly-state and private-state samples. In each trial
calculate the difference in mean prices.

The steps more systematically:

**Step A.** Write each of the 42 prices on a card and shuffle.

**Steps B and C (combined in this case).** i) Draw cards randomly
without replacement into groups of 16 and 26 cards. Then ii) calculate
the mean price difference between the groups, and iii) compare the
simulation-trial difference to the observed mean difference of \$4.84 --
\$4.35 = \$.49; if it is as great or greater than \$.49, write "yes,"
otherwise "no."

**Step D.** Repeat step B-C a hundred or a thousand times. Calculate the
proportion "yes," which estimates the probability we seek.

The probability that the postulated universe would produce a difference
between groups as large or larger than observed in 1961 is estimated by
how frequently the mean of the group of randomly-chosen sixteen prices
from the simulated stateownership universe is less than (or equal to)
the mean of the actual sixteen state-ownership prices.

Please notice how the only difference between this treatment of the
problem and the treatment in Chapter 7 is that the drawing in this case
is without replacement whereas in Chapter 7 the drawing is with
replacement.

In Chapter 7 we thought of these states as if they came from a
non-finite universe, which is one possible interpretation in one
context. But one can also reasonably think about them in another
context — as if they constitute the entire universe (aside from those
states excluded from the analysis because of data complexities). If so,
one can ask: If these 42 states constitute a universe, how likely is it
that one would choose two samples at random, containing 16 and 26
observations, that would have prices as different as \$.49 (the
difference that was actually observed)?

## Example 8-10: A Compound Problem: Five or More Spades in One Bridge Hand, and Four Girls and a Boy in a Five-Child Family

"Compound" does not necessarily mean "complicated". It means that the
problem is a compound of two or more simpler problems.

A natural way to handle such a compound problem is in stages, as we saw
in the archery problem. If a "success" is achieved in the first stage,
go on to the second stage; if not, don't go on. More specifically in
this example:

**Step 1.** Use a bridge card deck, and five coins with heads = "girl".

**Step 2.** Deal a 13-card bridge hand and count the spades. If 5 or
more spades, record "no" and end the experimental trial. Otherwise,
continue to step 3.

**Step 3.** Throw five coins, and count "heads." If four heads, record
"yes," otherwise record "no."

**Step 4.** Repeat steps 2 and 3 a thousand times.

**Step 5.** Compute the proportion of "yes" in step 3. This estimates
the probability sought.

The RESAMPLING STATS solution to "Compound" is neither long nor
difficult. We tackle it almost as if the two parts of the problem were
to be dealt with separately. We first determine, in a random bridge
hand, whether 5 spades or more are dealt, as was done in the problem
"Spades." Then, IF 5 or more spades are found, we proceed to GENERATE a
random family of 5 children. This means that we need not GENERATE
families if 5 or more spades were not dealt to the bridge hand, because
a "success" is only recorded if both conditions are met. After we SCORE
the number of girls in each sample of 5 children, we need only END the
loop and COUNT the number of samples that had 4 girls. Since we only
drew samples of children for those trials in which a bridge hand of 5
spades had already been dealt, we will have in K the number of trials
out of 1000 in which both conditions were met.

`           URN 13#1 39#0 deck         `

Deck with 13 spades ("1") and 39 other cards (0)

`           REPEAT 1000         `

Do the following experiment 1000 times.

`           SHUFFLE deck deck$         `

Shuffle the deck.

`           TAKE b deck$ 1,13 hand         `

Deal out one hand of 13 cards.

`           COUNT hand =1 spades         `

Find out how many of the 13 cards are spades (spades are represented by
the number 1).

`           IF spades >= 5         `

If we have 5 or more spades\...

`           GENERATE 5 1,2 a         `

Create a family of 5 children, randomly selecting among girls (1's) and
boys (2's).

`           COUNT a =1 j         `

Count the number of girls.

`           SCORE j z         `

Keep track of the number of girls in each trial. Recall that we are only
counting girls if we have already gotten five spades in the bridge hand.

`           END         `

`           END         `

End the IF condition.

End the experiment, go back and repeat until all 1000 trials are
complete.

`           COUNT z =4 k         `

Count the number of times we got 4 girls (and 5 or more spades).

`           DIVIDE k 1000 kk         `

Convert to a proportion.

`           PRINT kk         `

Print the results.

```{python, opts.label="py_ed"}
N = 10000
trial_results = np.zeros(N, dtype=bool)

# Deck with 13 spades (ones) and 39 other cards (zeros)
deck = np.repeat([1, 0], [13, 39])

for i in range(N):
    # Shuffle deck and draw 13 cards
    hand = np.random.choice(deck, 13, replace=False)

    spades = np.sum(hand)

    if spades >= 5:
        # Generate a family, zeros for boys, ones for girls
        children = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=5)
        girls = np.sum(children)
        if girls == 4:
            trial_results[i] = True

k = np.count_nonzero(trial_results)

kk = k / N

print(kk)
```

Alternative:

```{python, opts.label="py_ed"}
N = 10000
trial_spades = np.zeros(N, dtype=int)
trial_girls = np.zeros(N, dtype=int)

# Deck with 13 spades (ones) and 39 other cards (zeros)
deck = np.repeat([1, 0], [13, 39])

for i in range(N):
    # Shuffle deck and draw 13 cards
    hand = np.random.choice(deck, 13, replace=False)

    spades = np.sum(hand)
    trial_spades[i] = spades

    # Generate a family, zeros for boys, ones for girls
    children = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=5)
    girls = np.sum(children)
    trial_girls[i] = girls

k = np.count_nonzero((trial_spades >= 5) & (trial_girls == 4))

kk = k / N

print(kk)
```

**Note:** Last version is a fraction more expensive, but has the
    advantage that the condition we are testing for is summarized on
    one line.  However, this would not be a good approach to take if
    the experiments were not completely unrelated.

**Note:** Different result from book.

Result: kk = .01 (this is according to book)

## Summary

This completes the discussion of problems in probability — that is,
problems where we assume that the structure is known. Whereas Chapter 7
dealt with samples drawn from universes considered *not finite* , this
chapter deals with problems drawn from *finite universes* and therefore
you *sample without replacement* .
