Bayesian analysis is a way of thinking about problems in probability and
statistics that can help one reach otherwise-difficult decisions. It
also can sometimes be used in science. The range of its recommended uses
is controversial, but this chapter deals only with those uses of
Bayesian analysis that are uncontroversial.

Better than defining Bayesian analysis in formal terms is to
demonstrate its use. We shall start with the simplest sort of problem,
and proceed gradually from there.

## Simple decision problems

**Assessing the Likelihood That a Used Car Will Be Sound**

Consider a problem in estimating the soundness of a used car one
considers purchasing (after [@wonnacott1990introductory, pages 93--94]).
Seventy percent of the cars are known to be OK on average, and 30 percent are
faulty. Of the cars that *are* really OK, a mechanic correctly identifies 80
percent as "OK" but says that 20 percent are "faulty"; of those that are
faulty, the mechanic correctly identifies 90 percent as faulty and says
(incorrectly) that 10 percent are OK.

We wish to know the probability that if the mechanic *says* a car is
"OK," it *really* is faulty.  Phrased differently, what is the
probability of a car being faulty if the mechanic said it was OK?

We can get the desired probabilities directly by simulation without
knowing Bayes' rule, as we shall see. But one must be able to model the
physical problem correctly in order to proceed with the simulation; this
requirement of a clearly visualized model is a strong point in favor of simulation.

1. Note that we are only interested in outcomes where the mechanic
   approved a car.

2. For each car, generate a label of either
   "faulty" or "working" with probabilities of 0.3 and 0.7, respectively.

3. For each *faulty car*, we generate one of two labels, "approved" or
   "not approved" with probabilities 0.1 and 0.9, respectively.

4. For each *working car*, we generate one of two labels, "approved" or
   "not approved" with probabilities 0.7 and 0.3, respectively.

5. Out of all cars "approved", count how many are "faulty".
   The ratio between these numbers is our answer.

Here is the whole thing:

```{python, opts.label="py_ed"}
import numpy as np

N = 10000  # number of cars

# Counters for number of approved, number of approved and faulty
approved = 0
approved_and_faulty = 0

for i in range(N):

    # Decide whether the car is faulty or working, with a probability of
    # 0.3 and 0.7 respectively
    car = np.random.choice(['faulty', 'working'], p=[0.3, 0.7])

    if car == 'faulty':
        # What the mechanic says of a faulty car
        mechanic_says = np.random.choice(['approved', 'not approved'], p=[0.1, 0.9])
    else:
        # What the mechanic says of a working car
        mechanic_says = np.random.choice(['approved', 'not approved'], p=[0.7, 0.3])

    if mechanic_says == 'approved':
        approved += 1

        if car == 'faulty':
            approved_and_faulty += 1

k = approved_and_faulty / approved

print(f'{k * 100:.2}%')
```

The answer looks to be somewhere between 5 and 6%.  The code clearly follows the description step by step, but it is also quite slow.  If we can improve the code, we may be able to do our simulation with more cars, and get a more accurate answer.

Let's use arrays to store the states of all cars in the lot simultaneously:

```{python, opts.label="py_ed"}
N = 1000000  # number of cars; we made this number larger by a factor of 100

# Generate an array with as many entries as there are cars, each
# being either 'working' or 'faulty'
cars = np.random.choice(['working', 'faulty'], p=[0.7, 0.3], size=N)

# Count how many cars are working
N_working = np.count_nonzero(cars == 'working')

# All the rest are faulty
N_faulty = N - N_working

# Create a new array in which to store what a mechanic says
# about the car: 'approved' or 'not approved'
mechanic_says = np.empty_like(cars, dtype=object)

# We start with the working cars; what does the mechanic say about them?
# Generate 'approved' or 'not approved' labels with the given probabilities.
mechanic_says[cars == 'working'] = np.random.choice(
    ['approved', 'not approved'], p=[0.8, 0.2], size=N_working
)

# Similarly, for each faulty car, generate 'approved'/'not approved'
# labels with the given probabilities.
mechanic_says[cars == 'faulty'] = np.random.choice(
    ['approved', 'not approved'], p=[0.1, 0.9], size=N_faulty
)

# Identify all cars that were approved
# This produces a binary mask, an array that looks like:
# [True, False, False, True, ... ]
approved = (mechanic_says == 'approved')

# Identify cars that are faulty AND were approved
faulty_but_approved = (cars == 'faulty') & approved

# Count the number of cars that are faulty but approved, as well as
# the total number of cars that were approved
N_faulty_but_approved = np.count_nonzero(faulty_but_approved)
N_approved = np.count_nonzero(approved)

# Calculate the ratio, which is the answer we seek
k = N_faulty_but_approved / N_approved

print(f'{k * 100:.2}%')
```

The code now runs much faster, and with a larger number of cars we see that the answer is closer to a 5% chance of a car being broken after it has been
approved by a mechanic.

### Calculation without simulation

Simulation forces us to model our problem clearly and concretely in code.
Such code is most often easier to reason about than opaque statistical methods.
Running the simulation gives a good sense of what the correct answer should be.
Thereafter, we can still look into different — sometimes more elegant or
accurate — ways of modeling and solving the problem.

Let's examine the following diagram of our car selection:

![](diagrams/car-tree.png)

We see that there are two paths, highlighted, that results in a car
being approved by a mechanic.  Either a car can be working, and
correctly identified as such by a mechanic; or the car can be broken,
while the mechanic mistakenly determines it to be working. Our
question only pertains to these two paths, so we do not need to
study the rest of the tree.

In the long run, in our simulation, about 70% of the cars will end
with the label "working", and about 30% will end up with the label
"faulty". We just took 10000 sample cars above but, in fact, the
larger the number of cars we take, the closer we will get to 70%
"working" and 30% "faulty". So, with many samples, we can think of 70%
of these samples flowing down the "working" path, and 30% flowing
along the "faulty" path.

Now, we want to know, of all the cars approved by a mechanic, how many
are faulty:

$$ \frac{\mathrm{cars_{\mathrm{faulty}}}}{\mathrm{cars}_{\mathrm{approved}}} $$

We follow the two highlighted paths in the tree:

1. Of a large sample of cars, 30% are faulty.  Of these, 10% are
   approved by a mechanic.  That is, 30% * 10% = 3% of all cars.
2. Of all cars, 70% work.  Of these, 80% are approved by a mechanic.  That is,
   70% * 80% = 56% of all cars.

The percentage of faulty cars, out of approved cars, becomes:

$$
3\% / (56\% + 3\%) = 5.08\%
$$

Notation-wise, it is a bit easier to calculate these sums using proportions rather than percentages:

1. Faulty cars approved by a mechanic: 0.3 * 0.1 = 0.03
2. Working cars approved by a mechanic: 0.7 * 0.8 = 0.56

Fraction of faulty cars out of approved cars: 0.03 / (0.03 + 0.56) = 0.0508

We see that every time the tree branches, it filters the cars: some go to one branch, the rest to another.  In our code, we used the AND (`&`) operator to find the intersection between faulty AND approved cars, i.e., to filter out from all faulty cars only the cars that were ALSO approved.

### Probability interpretation

**Probability from proportion**

In these examples, we often calculate proportions.
In the given simulation:

- How many cars are approved by a mechanic?  59/100.
- How many of those 59 were faulty? 3/59.

We often also count how commonly events occur: "it rained 4 out of the 10 days".

An extension of this idea is to *predict* the probability of an event occurring, based on what we had seen in the past.
We can say "out of 100 days, there was some rain on 20 of them; we therefore estimate that the probability of rain occurring is 20/100".
Of course, this is not a complex or very accurate weather model; for that, we'd need to take other factors—such as season—into consideration.
Overall, the more observations we have, the better our probability estimates become.
We discussed this idea previously in "The Law of Large Numbers".

<!---
** TODO: REFERENCE SECTION ON LARGE NUMBERS **
-->

**Ratios of proportions**

At our mechanic's yard, we can ask "how many red cars here are faulty"?
To calculate that, we'd first count the number of red cars, then the number of those red cars that are also broken, then calculate the ratio: `red_cars_faulty / red_cars`.

We could just as well have worked in percentages: `percentage_of_red_cars_broken / percentage_of_cars_that_are_red`, since
that is `(red_cars_broken / 100) / (red_cars / 100)`—the same ratio calculated before.

Our point is that the denominator doesn't matter when calculating ratios, so we
could just as well have written:

(red_cars_broken / all_cars) / (red_cars / all_cars)

or

$$
P(\text{cars that are red and that are broken}) / P(\text{red cars})
$$

<!---
** TODO: THE ABOVE MAY BE A SUBTLE POINT THAT NEEDS TO EXPANDED, BUT THE TEXT IS GETTING LONG AS-IS **
-->

**Probability relationships: conditional probability**

Here's one way of writing the probability that a car is broken:

$$
P(\text{car is broken})
$$

We can shorten "car is broken" to B, and write the same thing as:

$$
P(B)
$$

Similarly, we could write the probability that a car is red as:

$$
P(R)
$$

We might also want to express the *conditional probability*, as in the
probability that the car is broken, *given that* we already know that the car
is red:

$$
P(\text{car is broken GIVEN THAT car is red})
$$

That is getting getting pretty verbose, so we will shorten this as we did above:

$$
P(B \text{ GIVEN THAT } R)
$$

To make things even more compact, we write "GIVEN THAT" as a vertical bar `|` — so the whole thing becomes:

$$
P(B | R)
$$

We read this as "the probability that the car is broken given that the car is red".
Such a probability is known as a *conditional probability*.  We discuss these in more details in Ch X

<!---
**TODO: ADD REFERENCE TO CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY**
-->.

In our original problem, we ask what the chance is of a car being broken given that a mechanic approved it.  As discussed under "Ratios of proportions", it can be calculated with:

$$
P(\text{car broken | mechanic approved})
= P(\text{car broken and mechanic approved}) / P(\text{mechanic approved})
$$

We have already used $B$ to mean "broken" (above), so let us use $A$ to mean "mechanic approved".  Then we can write the statement above in a more compact way:

$$
P(B | A) = P(B \text{ and } A) / P(A)
$$

As we use $|$ to mean "GIVEN THAT", we can also use the $\cap$ symbol to mean "and":

$$
P(B | A) = P(B \cap A) / P(A)
$$

To put this generally, conditional probabilities for two events $X$ and $Y$ can be written as:

$P(X | Y) = P(X \cap Y) / P(Y)$

Where (again) $\cap$ means "and", i.e. that both happen simultaneously.

**Example: conditional probability**

Let's discuss a very relevant example.  You get a COVID test, and the test is negative.  Now, you would like to know what the chance is of you having COVID.

We have the following information:

- 1.5% of people in your area have COVID
- The false positive rate of the tests (i.e., that they detect COVID when it is absent) is very low at 0.5%
- The false negative rate (i.e., that they fail to detect COVID when it is present) is quite high at 40%

![](diagrams/covid-tree.png)

Again, we start with our simulation.

```{python, opts.label="py_ed"}
# The number of people
N = 1000000

# For each person, generate a True or False label,
# indicating that they have / don't have COVID
person_has_covid = np.random.choice(
    [True, False], p=[0.015, 0.985],
    size=N
)

# Calculate the numbers of people with and without COVID
N_with_covid = np.count_nonzero(person_has_covid)
N_without_covid = N - N_with_covid

# In this array, we will store, for each person, whether they
# had a positive or a negative test
test_result = np.zeros_like(person_has_covid, dtype=bool)

# Draw test results for people with COVID
test_result[person_has_covid] = np.random.choice(
    [True, False], p=[0.6, 0.4],
    size=N_with_covid
)

# Draw test results for people without COVID
test_result[~person_has_covid] = np.random.choice(
    [True, False], p=[0.005, 0.995],
    size=N_without_covid
)

# Get the COVID statuses of all those with negative tests
# (`test_result` is a boolean mask, like `[True, False, False, True, ...]`,
# and `~test_result` flips all boolean values to `[False, True, True, False, ...]`.
covid_status_negative_test = person_has_covid[~test_result]

# Now, count how many with COVID had a negative test results
N_with_covid_and_negative_test = np.count_nonzero(covid_status_negative_test)

# And how many people, overall, had negative test results
N_with_negative_test = len(covid_status_negative_test)

k = N_with_covid_and_negative_test / N_with_negative_test

print(k)
```

This gives around 0.006 or 0.6%.

Now that we have a rough indication of what the answer should be, let's try and calculate it directly, based on the tree of informatiom shown earlier.

We use $P^+$/$P^-$ to indicate COVID positive or negative, and
$P(T^+)$/$P(T^-)$ to indicate positive or negative test results.

You would like to know the probability of having COVID *given that* your test was negative.  Using the conditional probability relationship from above, we can write:

$$
P(C^+ | T^-) = P(C^+ \cap T^-) / P(T^-)
$$

We see from the tree diagram that $P(C^+ \cap T^-) = P(T^- | C^+) * P(C^+) = .4 * .015 = 0.006$.

<!---
**TODO: ADD REFERENCE TO SUMMATION OF MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE PROBABILITIES**
-->

We observe that $P(T^-) = P(T^- \cap C^-) + P(T^- \cap C^+)$, i.e. that we can obtain a negative test result through two paths, having COVID or not having COVID.  We expand these further as conditional probabilities:

$P(T^- \cap C^-) = P(T^- | C^-) * P(C^-)$

and

$P(T^- \cap C^+) = P(T^- | C^+) * P(C^+)$.

We can now calculate

$$
P(T^-) = P(T^- | C^-) * P(C^-) + P(T^- | C^+) * P(C^+)
$$

$$
= .995 * .985 + .4 * .015 = 0.986
$$

The answer, then, is:

$P(C^+ | T^-) = 0.006 / 0.986 = 0.0061$ or 0.61%.

This matches very closely our simulation result, so we have some confidence that we have done the calculation correctly.

**Estimating Driving Risk for Insurance Purposes**

Another sort of introductory problem, following after @feller1968introduction,
p 122:

A mutual insurance company charges its members according to the risk
of having an car accident. It is known that there are two classes of
people — 80 percent of the population with good driving judgment and
with a probability of .06 of having an accident each year, and 20
percent with poor judgment and a probability of .6 of having an
accident each year. The company's policy is to charge \$100 for each
percent of risk, i. e., a driver with a probability of .6 should pay
60\*\$100 = \$6000.

If nothing is known of a driver except that they had an accident last
year, what fee should they pay?

Another way to phrase this question is: given that a driver had an accident last year, what is the probability of them having an accident overall?

We will proceed as follows:

1. Generate a population of N people.  Label each as `good driver` or `poor driver`.

1. Simulate the last year for each person: did they have an accident or not?

2. Select only the ones that had an accident last year.

3. Among those, calculate what their average risk is of making an accident.  This will indicate the appropriate insurance premium.

```{python, opts.label="py_ed"}
N = 100000
cost_per_percent = 100

people = np.random.choice(
    ['good driver', 'poor driver'], p=[0.8, 0.2],
    size=N
)

good_driver = (people == 'good driver')
poor_driver = ~good_driver

# Did they have an accident last year?
had_accident = np.zeros(N, dtype=bool)
had_accident[good_driver] = np.random.choice(
    [True, False], p=[0.06, 0.94],
    size=np.count_nonzero(good_driver)
)
had_accident[poor_driver] = np.random.choice(
    [True, False], p=[0.6, 0.4],
    size=np.count_nonzero(poor_driver)
)

ppl_with_accidents = people[had_accident]
N_good_driver_accidents = np.count_nonzero(ppl_with_accidents == 'good driver')
N_poor_driver_accidents = np.count_nonzero(ppl_with_accidents == 'poor driver')
N_all_with_accidents = N_good_driver_accidents + N_poor_driver_accidents

avg_risk_percent = (N_good_driver_accidents * 0.06 +
                    N_poor_driver_accidents * 0.6) / N_all_with_accidents * 100

premium = avg_risk_percent * cost_per_percent

print(f'{premium:.0f} USD')

```

The answer should be around 4450 USD.

**Screening for Disease**

<!---
**TODO: SHALL WE REMOVE THIS PROBLEM, OR INTEGRATE PARTS OF ITS DESCRIPTION WITH THE COVID EXAMPLE?**
-->

This is a classic Bayesian problem (quoted by Tversky and Kahneman
[-@tversky1982evidential, page 154], from Cascells *et al.*
[-@cascells1978interpretation, page 999]):

> If a test to detect a disease whose prevalence is 1/1000 has a false
positive rate of 5%, what is the chance that a person found to have a positive
result actually has the disease, assuming you know nothing about the person's
symptoms or signs?

Tversky and Kahneman note that among the respondents — students and staff at
Harvard Medical School — "the most common response, given by almost half of
the participants, was 95%" — very much the wrong answer.

To obtain an answer by simulation, we may rephrase the question above
with (hypothetical) absolute numbers as follows:

If a test to detect a disease whose prevalence has been estimated to be
about 100,000 in the population of 100 million persons over age 40 (that
is, about 1 in a thousand) has been observed to have a false positive
rate of 60 in 1200 observations, and never gives a negative result if a
person really has the disease, what is the chance that a person found to
have a positive result actually has the disease, assuming you know
nothing about the person's symptoms or signs?

If the raw numbers are not available, the problem can be phrased in such
terms as "about 1 case in 1000" and "about 5 false positives in 100
cases.")

One may obtain an answer as follows:

1.  Construct bucket A with 999 white beads and 1 black bead, and bucket B
    with 95 green beads and 5 red beads. A more complete problem that
    also discusses false negatives would need a third bucket.

2.  Pick a bead from bucket A. If black, record "T," replace the bead, and
    end the trial. If white, continue to step 3.

3.  If a white bead is drawn from bucket A, select a bead from bucket

    B. If red, record "F" and replace the bead, and if green record "N"
    and replace the bead.

4.  Repeat steps 2-4 perhaps 10,000 times, and in the results count the
    proportion of "T"s to ("T"s plus "F"s) ignoring the "N"s).

    Of course 10,000 draws would be tedious, but even after a few
    hundred draws a person would be likely to draw the correct
    conclusion that the proportion of "T"s to ("T"s plus "F"s) would be
    small. And it is easy with a computer to do 10,000 trials very
    quickly.

    Note that the respondents in the Cascells *et al.* study were not naive;
    the medical staff members were supposed to understand statistics. Yet most
    doctors and other personnel offered wrong answers. If simulation can do
    better than the standard deductive method, then simulation would seem to
    be the method of choice. And only one piece of training for simulation is
    required: Teach the habit of saying "I'll simulate it" and then actually
    doing so.

## Fundamental problems in statistical practice

Box and Tiao [-@box1992bayesian] begin their classic exposition of Bayesian
statistics with the analysis of a famous problem first published by Fisher
[-@fisher1959statistical, page 18].

> ...there are mice of two colors, black and brown. The black mice are
> of two genetic kinds, homozygotes (*BB*) and heterozygotes (*Bb*),
> and the brown mice are of one kind (*bb*). It is known from
> established genetic theory that the probabilities associated with
> offspring from various matings are as listed in @tbl-mice-genetics.

                   BB (black)  Bb (black)  bb (brown)
------------------ ----------- ----------- ----------
BB mated with bb   0           1           0
Bb mated with bb   0           ½           ½
Bb mated with Bb   ¼           ½           ¼
------------------ ----------- ----------- ----------

: Probabilities for Genetic Character of Mice Offspring [@box1992bayesian, pp. 12-14] {#tbl-mice-genetics}

Suppose we have a "test" mouse which has been produced
by a mating between two (*Bb*) mice and is black.
What is the genetic kind of this mouse?

To answer that, we look at the information in the last line of the table:
it shows that the probabilities of a test mouse is of kind *BB* and *Bb* are precisely known, and are 1/3 and 2/3 respectively ((1/4)/(1/4 + 1/2) vs (1/2)/(1/4 + 1/2)).  We call this our "prior" estimate — in other words, our estimate before seeing data.

Suppose the test mouse is now mated with a brown mouse (of kind *bb*) and
produces seven black offspring. Before, we thought that it was more likely for
the parent to be of kind *Bb* than of kind *BB*. But if that were true, then
we would have expected to have seen some brown offspring (the probability of
mating *Bb* with *bb* resulting in brown offspring is given as 0.5).
Therefore, we sense that it may now be more likely that the parent was of type
*BB* instead. How do we quantify that?

One can calculate, as Fisher [-@fisher1959statistical, page 19] did, the
probabilities after seeing the data (we call this the *posterior*
probability). This is typically done using using Bayes' rule.

But instead of doing that, let's take the easy route out and simulate
the situation instead.

1.  We begin, as do Box and Tiao, by restricting our attention to the third
    line in Table @tbl-mice-genetics. We draw a mouse with label 'BB', 'Bb', or
    'bb', using those probabilities. We were told that the "test mouse" is
    black, so if we draw 'bb', we try again. (Alternatively, we could draw 'BB'
    and 'Bb' with probabilities of 1/3 and 2/3 respectively.)

2.  We now want to examine the offspring of the test mouse when mated
    with a brown "bb" mouse.  Specifically, we are only interested in
    cases where all offspring were black.  We will store the genetic
    kind of the parents of such offspring so that we can count them
    later.

    If our test mouse is "BB", we already know that all their offspring will
    be black ("Bb").  Thus, store "BB" in the parent list.

3.  If our test mouse is "Bb", we have a bit more work to do.  Draw
    seven offspring from the middle row of Table tbl-mice-genetics.
    If all the offspring are black, store "Bb" in the parent list.

4.  Repeat steps 1-3 perhaps 10000 times.

5.  Now, out of all parents count the numbers of "BB" vs "Bb".

We will do a naïve implementation that closely follows the logic described above, followed by a slightly optimized version.

```{python, opts.label="py_ed"}
N = 100000

parents = []

for i in range(N):
    test_mouse = np.random.choice(['BB', 'Bb', 'bb'], p=[0.25, 0.5, 0.25])

    # The test mouse is black; since we drew a brown mouse skip this trial
    if test_mouse == 'bb':
        continue

    # If the test mouse is 'BB', all 7 children are guaranteed to
    # be 'Bb' black.
    # Therefore, add 'BB' to the parent list.
    if test_mouse == 'BB':
        parents.append('BB')

    # If the parent mouse is 'Bb', we draw 7 children to
    # see whether all of them are black ('Bb').
    # The probabilities come from the middle row of the table.
    if test_mouse == 'Bb':
      children = np.random.choice(['Bb', 'bb'], p=[0.5, 0.5], size=7)
      if np.all(children == 'Bb'):
          parents.append('Bb')

# Now, count how many parents were 'BB' vs 'Bb'
parents = np.array(parents)

parents_BB = (parents == 'BB')
parents_Bb = (parents == 'Bb')
N_B = len(parents)

p_BB = np.count_nonzero(parents_BB) / N_B
p_Bb = np.count_nonzero(parents_Bb) / N_B

print(f'p_BB = {p_BB:.3f}')
print(f'p_Bb = {p_Bb:.3f}')
print(f'Ratio: {p_BB/p_Bb:.1f}')
```

We see that all the offspring being black considerably changes the
situation!
We started with the odds being 2:1 in favor of Bb vs BB.
The "posterior" or "after the evidence" ratio is closer to 64:1 in
favor of *BB*! (1973, pp. 12-14)

Let's tune the code a bit to run faster.  Instead of doing the trials
one mouse at a time, we will do the whole bunch together.

```{python, opts.label="py_ed"}
N = 1000000

# In N trials, pair two Bb mice and generate a child
test_mice = np.random.choice(['BB', 'Bb', 'bb'], p=[0.25, 0.5, 0.25], size=N)

# The resulting test mouse is black, so filter out all brown ones
test_mice = test_mice[test_mice != 'bb']
M = len(test_mice)

# Each test mouse will now be mated with a brown mouse, producing 7 offspring.
# We then store whether all the offspring were black or not.
all_offspring_black = np.zeros(M, dtype=bool)

# If a test mouse is 'BB', we are assured that all its offspring
# will be black
all_offspring_black[test_mice == 'BB'] = True

# If a test mouse is 'Bb', we have to generate its offspring and
# see whether they are all black or not
test_mice_Bb = (test_mice == 'Bb')
N_test_mice_Bb = np.count_nonzero(test_mice_Bb)

# Generate all offspring of all 'Bb' test mice
offspring = np.random.choice(
    ['Bb', 'bb'], p=[0.5, 0.5], size=(N_test_mice_Bb, 7)
)
all_offspring_black[test_mice_Bb] = np.all(offspring == 'Bb', axis=1)

# Find the genetic types of the parents of all-black offspring
parents = test_mice[all_offspring_black]

# Calculate what fraction of parents were 'BB' vs 'Bb'
parents_BB = (parents == 'BB')
parents_Bb = (parents == 'Bb')
N_B = np.count_nonzero(all_offspring_black)

p_BB = np.count_nonzero(parents_BB) / N_B
p_Bb = np.count_nonzero(parents_Bb) / N_B

print(f'p_BB = {p_BB:.3f}')
print(f'p_Bb = {p_Bb:.3f}')
print(f'Ratio: {p_BB/p_Bb:.1f}')
```

This yields a similar result, but in much shorter time — which means we can increase the number of trials and get a more accurate result.

Creating the correct simulation procedure is not trivial, because Bayesian
reasoning is subtle — a reason it has been the cause of controversy
for more than two centuries. But it certainly is not easier to create a
correct procedure using analytic tools (except in the cookbook sense of
plug-and-pray). And the difficult mathematics that underlie the
analytic method (see e.g. [@box1992bayesian, Appendix A1.1] make it almost
impossible for the statistician to fully understand the procedure from
beginning to end. If one is interested in insight, the simulation procedure
might well be preferred.[^sequentially]

[^sequentially]: We can use a similar procedure to illustrate an aspect of the
    Bayesian procedure that Box and Tiao emphasize, its
    sequentially-consistent character. First let us carry out the above
    procedure but observe only three black balls in a row. The program to be
    used is the same except for the insertion of "3" for "7" where "7"
    appears. We then estimate the probability for BB, which turns out to be
    about 1/5 instead of about 1/65. We then substitute for bucket A a bucket
    A' with appropriate numbers of black Bb's and black BB's, to represent the
    "updated" prior probability. We may then continue by substituting "4" for
    "3" above (to attain a total of seven observed black balls), and find that
    the probability is about what it was when we observed 7 black balls in
    a single sample (1/65). This shows that the Bayesian procedure accumulates
    information without "leakage" and with consistency.

## Problems based on normal and other distributions

This section should be skipped by all except advanced practitioners of
statistics.

Much of the work in Bayesian analysis for scientific purposes treats the
combining of prior distributions having Normal and other standard shapes
with sample evidence which may also be represented with such standard
functions. The mathematics involved often is formidable, though some of
the calculational formulas are fairly simple and even intuitive.

These problems may be handled with simulation by replacing the Normal
(or other) distribution with the original raw data when data are
available, or by a set of discrete sub-universes when distributions are
subjective.

Measured data from a continuous distribution present a special problem
because the probability of any one observed value is very low, often
approaching zero, and hence the probability of a given set of observed
values usually cannot be estimated sensibly; this is the reason for the
conventional practice of working with a continuous distribution itself,
of course. But a simulation necessarily works with discrete values. A
feasible procedure must bridge this gulf.

The logic for a problem of Schlaifer's [-@schlaifer1961introduction, example
17.1] will only be sketched out. The procedure is rather novel, but it has not
heretofore been published and therefore must be considered tentative and
requiring particular scrutiny.

**An Intermediate Problem in Conditional Probability**

Schlaifer employs a quality-control problem for his leading example of
Bayesian estimation with Normal sampling. A chemical manufacturer wants
to estimate the amount of yield of a crucial ingredient X in a batch of
raw material in order to decide whether it should receive special
handling. The yield ranges between 2 and 3 pounds (per gallon), and the
manufacturer has compiled the distribution of the last 100 batches.

The manufacturer currently uses the decision rule that if the mean of
nine samples from the batch (which vary only because of measurement
error, which is the reason that he takes nine samples rather than just
one) indicates that the batch mean is greater than 2.5 gallons, the
batch is accepted. The first question Schlaifer asks, as a
sampling-theory waystation to the more general question, is the
likelihood that a given batch with any given yield — say 2.3
gallons — will produce a set of samples with a mean as great or greater
than 2.5 gallons.

We are told that the manufacturer has in hand nine samples from a given
batch; they are 1.84, 1.75, 1.39, 1.65, 3.53, 1.03,

2.73, 2.86, and 1.96, with a mean of 2.08. Because we are also told that
the manufacturer considers the extent of sample variation to be the same
at all yield levels, we may — if we are again working with 2.3 as our
example of a possible universe — therefore add (2.3 minus 2.08 =) 0.22
to each of these nine observations, so as to constitute a bootstrap-type
universe; we do this on the grounds that this is our best guess about
the constitution of that distribution with a mean at (say) 2.3.

We then repeatedly draw samples of nine observations from this
distribution (centered at 2.3) to see how frequently its mean exceeds
2.5. This work is so straightforward that we need not even state the
steps in the procedure.

**Estimating the Posterior Distribution**

Next we estimate the posterior distribution. @fig-batch_posterior shows the
prior distribution of batch yields, based on 100 previous batches.

```{r fig-batch_posterior, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Posterior distribution of batch yields"}
include_svg('diagrams/batch_posterior.svg')
```

Notation: S ~m~ = set of batches (where total S = 100) with a particular
mean m (say, m = 2.1). x ~i~ = particular observation (say, x ~3~ =
1.03). s = the set of x ~i~ .

We now perform for each of the S ~m~ (categorized into the
tenth-of-gallon divisions between 2.1 and 3.0 gallons), each
corresponding to one of the yields ranging from 2.1 to 3.0, the same
sort of sampling operation performed for S ~m=2.3~ in the previous
problem. But now, instead of using the manufacturer's decision criterion
of 2.5, we construct an interval of arbitrary width around the sample
mean of 2.08 — say at .1 intervals from 2.03 to 2.13 — and then work with the
weighted proportions of sample means that fall into this interval.

1.  Using a bootstrap-like approach, we presume that the sub-universe of
    observations related to each S ~m~ equals the mean of that S ~m~
    — say, 2.1) plus (minus) the mean of the x ~i~ (equals 2.05) added
    to (subtracted from) each of the nine x ~i~ , say, 1.03 + .05 = 1.08. For
    a distribution centered at 2.3, the values would be (1.84 + .22 = 2.06,
    1.75 + .22 = 1.97...).

2.  Working with the distribution centered at 2.3 as an example:
    Constitute a universe of the values (1.84+.22=2.06, 1.75 + .22 =
    1.97...). Here we may notice that the variability in the sample
    enters into the analysis at this point, rather than when the sample
    evidence is combined with the prior distribution; this is in
    contrast to conventional Bayesian practice where the posterior is
    the result of the prior and sample means weighted by the reciprocals of the
    variances (see e.g. [@box1992bayesian, page 17 and Appendix A1.1]).

3.  Draw nine observations from this universe (with replacement, of
    course), compute the mean, and record.

4.  Repeat step 2 perhaps 1000 times and plot the distribution of
    outcomes.

5.  Compute the percentages of the means within (say) .5 on each side of
    the sample mean, i. e. from 2.03--2.13. The resulting number — call
    it UP ^i^ — is the un-standardized (un-normalized) effect of this
    sub-distribution in the posterior distribution.

6.  Repeat steps 1-5 to cover each other possible batch yield from 2.0
    to 3.0 (2.3 was just done).

7.  Weight each of these sub-distributions — actually, its UP ^i^ --- by
    its prior probability, and call that WP ^i^ -.

8.  Standardize the WP ^i^ s to a total probability of 1.0. The result
    is the posterior distribution. The value found is 2.283, which the
    reader may wish to compare with a theoretically-obtained result
    (which Schlaifer does not give).

    This procedure must be biased because the numbers of "hits" will
    differ between the two sides of the mean for all sub-distributions
    except that one centered at the same point as the sample, but the
    extent and properties of this bias are as-yet unknown. The bias
    would seem to be smaller as the interval is smaller, but a small
    interval requires a large number of simulations; a satisfactorily
    narrow interval surely will contain relatively few trials, which is
    a practical problem of still-unknown dimensions.

    Another procedure — less theoretically justified and probably more
    biased — intended to get around the problem of the narrowness of the
    interval, is as follows:

    **5a.** Compute the percentages of the means on each side of the
    sample mean, and note the smaller of the two (or in another possible
    process, the difference of the two). The resulting number — call it
    UP ^i^ — is the un-standardized (un-normalized) weight of this
    sub-distribution in the posterior distribution.

    Another possible criterion — a variation on the procedure in 5a — is
    the *difference* between the two tails; for a universe with the same
    mean as the sample, this difference would be zero.

## Conclusion

All but the simplest problems in conditional probability are
confusing to the intuition even if not difficult mathematically. But
when one tackles Bayesian and other problems in probability with
experimental simulation methods rather than with logic, neither
simple nor complex problems need be difficult for experts or
beginners.

This chapter shows how simulation can be a helpful and illuminating
way to approach problems in Bayesian analysis.

Simulation has two valuable properties for Bayesian analysis:

1. It can provide an effective way to handle problems whose
   analytic solution may be difficult or impossible.

2. Simulation can provide insight to problems that otherwise are
   difficult to understand fully, as is peculiarly the case with
   Bayesian analysis.

Bayesian problems of updating estimates can be handled easily and
straightforwardly with simulation, whether the data are discrete or
continuous. The process and the results tend to be intuitive and
transparent. Simulation works best with the original raw data rather
than with abstractions from them via percentages and
distributions. This can aid the understanding as well as facilitate
computation.
