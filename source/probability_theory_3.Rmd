# Probability Theory, Part 3 {#sec-infinite-universes}

This chapter discusses problems whose appropriate concept of a universe
is not finite, whereas @sec-finite-universes discusses problems whose appropriate
concept of a universe is finite.

How can a universe be infinite yet known? Consider, for example, the
possible flips with a given coin; the number is not limited in any
meaningful sense, yet we understand the properties of the coin and the
probabilities of a head and a tail.

## Example: The Birthday Problem {#sec-birthday-problem}

This examples illustrates the probability of duplication in a multi-outcome
sample from an infinite universe.

As an indication of the power *and* simplicity of resampling methods,
consider this famous examination question used in probability courses:
What is the probability that two or more people among a roomful of (say)
twenty-five people will have the same birthday? To obtain an answer we
need simply examine the first twenty-five numbers from the random-number
table that fall between "001" and "365" (the number of days in the
year), record whether or not there is a duplication among the
twenty-five, and repeat the process often enough to obtain a reasonably
stable probability estimate.

Pose the question to a mathematical friend of yours, then watch her or
him sweat for a while, and afterwards compare your answer to hers/his. I
think you will find the correct answer very surprising. It is not
unheard of for people who know how this problem works to take advantage
of their knowledge by making and winning big bets on it. (See how a bit
of knowledge of probability can immediately be profitable to you by
avoiding such unfortunate occurrences?)

More specifically, these steps answer the question for the case of
twenty-five people in the room:

* **Step 1.** Let three-digit random numbers 1-365 stand for the 365 days
  in the year. (Ignore leap year for simplicity.)
* **Step 2.** Examine for duplication among the first twenty-five random
  numbers chosen "001-365." (Triplicates or higher-order repeats are counted as
  duplicates here.) If there is one or more duplicate, record "yes." Otherwise
  record "no."
* **Step 3.** Repeat perhaps a thousand times, and calculate the proportion of
  a duplicate birthday among twenty-five people.

You would probably use the computer to generate the initial random numbers.

Now try the program written as follows.

We have dealt with this example in a rather intuitive and unsystematic fashion.
From here on, we will work in a more systematic, step-by-step manner. And from
here on the problems form an orderly sequence of the classical types of
problems in probability theory (@sec-infinite-universes and
@sec-finite-universes), and inferential statistics (@sec-framing-questions to
@sec-reliability-average.)

## Example: Three Daughters Among Four Children

This problem illustrates a problem with two outcomes (Binomial [^binomial]) and
sampling with Replacement Among Equally Likely Outcomes.

What is the probability that exactly three of the four children in a four-child
family will be daughters?[^what-is-a-daughter]

[^what-is-a-daughter]:  Here, by "daughter" or "girl", we just mean the
    assigned gender of the child at birth.  If we wanted to be more
    sophisticated, and work out the proportion of children who identify as
    female, we would need some statistics on the current likelihood of changing
    gender identification by age, the children's ages, and so on.

The first step is to state that the approximate probability that a single birth
will produce a daughter is 50-50 (1 in 2). This estimate is not strictly
correct, because there are roughly 106 male children born to each 100 female
children. But the approximation is close enough for most purposes, and the
50-50 split simplifies the job considerably. (Such "false" approximations are
part of the everyday work of the scientist. The appropriate question is not
whether or not a statement is "only" an approximation, but whether or not it is
a *good enough* approximation for your purposes.)

The probability that a fair coin will turn up heads is .50 or 50-50, close to
the probability of having a daughter. Therefore, flip a coin in groups of four
flips, and count how often three of the flips produce *heads*.  (You must
decide in *advance* whether three heads means three girls or three boys.) It is
as simple as that.

In resampling estimation it is of the highest importance to work in a careful,
step-by-step fashion â€” to write down the steps in the estimation, and then to
do the experiments just as described in the steps. Here are a set of steps that
will lead to a correct answer about the probability of getting three daughters
among four children:

* **Step 1.** Using coins, let "heads" equal "girl" and "tails" equal "boy."
* **Step 2.** Throw four coins.
* **Step 3.** Examine whether the four coins fall with exactly three heads up.
  If so, write "yes" on a record sheet; otherwise write "no."
* **Step 4.** Repeat step 2 perhaps two hundred times.
* **Step 5.** Count the proportion "yes." This proportion is an estimate of the
  probability of obtaining exactly 3 daughters in 4 children.

The first few experimental trials might appear in the record sheet as
follows (@tbl-coins-girls):

Number of Heads    Yes or No
---------------    ---------
1                   No
0                   No
3                   Yes
2                   No
1                   No
2                   No
...                 ...
...                 ...
...                 ...

: Example trials from the three-girls problem {#tbl-coins-girls}

The probability of getting three daughters in four births could also be
found with a deck of cards, a random number table, a die, or with
{{< var lang >}}. For example, half the cards in a deck are black, so the
probability of getting a black card ("daughter") from a full deck is 1 in 2.
Therefore, deal a card, record "daughter" or "son," *replace* the card,
shuffle, deal again, and so forth for 200 sets of four cards. Then count the
proportion of groups of four cards in which you got four daughters.

:::

Notice that the procedure outlined in the steps above would have been different
(though almost identical) if we asked about the probability of *three or more*
daughters rather than *exactly three* daughters among four children. For *three
or more* daughters we would have scored "yes" on our score-keeping pad for
*either* three or four heads, rather than for just three heads. Likewise, in
the computer solution we would have used the statement
[`n_three_girls = np.sum(girl_counts >= 3)`]{.python}
[`n_three_girls <- sum(girl_counts >= 3)`]{.r}.

It is important that, in this case, in contrast to what we did in
the example from @sec-one-pair (the introductory poker example), the card is
*replaced* each time so that each card is dealt from a full deck. This method
is known as *sampling with replacement*.  One samples with replacement whenever
the successive events are *independent* ; in this case we assume that the
chance of having a daughter remains the same (1 girl in 2 births) no matter
what sex the previous births were [^what-sex]. But, if the first card dealt is
black and would *not* be replaced, the chance of the second card being black
would no longer be 26 in 52 (.50), but rather 25 in 51 (.49), if the first
*three* cards are black and would not be replaced, the chances of the fourth
card's being black would sink to 23 in 49 (.47).

[^what-sex]: This assumption is slightly contrary to scientific fact. A better
    example would be: What is the probability that four mothers delivering
    successively in a hospital will all have daughters? But that example has
    other difficulties â€” which is the way science always is.

To push the illustration further, consider what would happen if we used
a deck of only six cards, half (3 of 6) black and half (3 of 6) red,
instead of a deck of 52 cards. If the chosen card is replaced each time,
the 6-card deck produces the same results as a 52-card deck; in fact, a
two-card deck would do as well. But, if the sampling is done *without*
replacement, it is *impossible* to obtain 4 "daughters" with the 6-card
deck because there are only 3 "daughters" in the deck. To repeat, then,
whenever you want to estimate the probability of some series of events
where each event is independent of the other, you must sample *with
replacement*.
## Variations of the daughters problem

In later chapters we will frequently refer to a problem which is
identical in basic structure to the problem of three girls in four
children â€” the probability of getting 9 females in ten calf births if
the probability of a female birth is (say) .5 â€” when we set this problem
in the context of the possibility that a genetic engineering practice is
effective in increasing the proportion of females (desirable for the
production of milk).

So far we have assumed the simple case where we have {{< var an_array >}} of
values that we are sampling from, and we are
selecting each of these values into the sample with equal probability.

For example, we started with the simple assumption that a child is just as
likely to be born a boy as a girl. Our input is:

```{python}
input_values = ['girl', 'boy']
```

```{r}
input_values = c('girl', 'boy')
```

By default, {{< var sample >}} will draw the input values with equal
probability.  Here, we draw a sample (`children`) of four values from the
input, where *each value* in `children` has an equal chance of being "girl" or
"boy".

```{python}
children = rnd.choice(input_values, size=4)
children
```

```{r}
children <- sample(input_values, size=4, replace=TRUE)
children
```

That is, {{< var sample >}} gives each element in `input_values` an equal
chance of being selected as the next element in `children`.

That is fine if we have some simple probability to simulate, like 0.5.  But now
let us imagine we want to get more precise.  We happen to know that any given
birth is just slightly more likely to be a boy than a girl.[^arbuthnot].  For
example, the [proportion of boys born in the
UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/gender-ratios-at-birth-in-great-britain-2010-to-2014)
is 0.513.  Hence the proportion of girls is 1-0.513 = 0.487.

[^arbuthnot]: This fact was the origin of the very first "significance test" in
    statistics.  In the early 1700s, John Arbuthnot
    [-@arbuthnot1710christenings] noticed that there were more christenings of
    boys than girls in London in every year for which he had figures.  He
    showed that this was vanishingly unlikely if male births were in fact
    exactly as likely as female births, and attributed this to divine
    providence, because society tended to lose males faster than females in in
    adulthood, due to manual labor and war.

## {{< var sample >}} and the [`prob`]{.r}[`p`]{.python} argument

We could replicate this probability of 0.487 for 'girl' in the output sample by
making an input array of 1000 strings, that contains 487 'girls' and 513
'boys':

```{python}
big_girls = np.repeat(['girl', 'boy'], [487, 513])
```

```{r}
big_girls <- rep(c('girl', 'boy'), c(487, 513))
```

Now if we sample using the default in {{< var sample >}}, each *element* in the
input `big_girls` array will have the same chance of appearing in the sample,
but because there are 487 'girls', and 513 'boys', each with an equal chance of
appearing in the sample, we will get a 'girl' in roughly 487 out of every 1000
elements we draw, and a boy roughly 513 / 1000 times.  That is, our chance of
any one element of being a 'girl' is, as we want, 0.487.

```{python}
# Now each element has probability 0.487 of 'girl', 0.513 of 'boy'.
realistic_children = rnd.choice(big_girls, size=4)
realistic_children
```

```{r}
# Now each element has probability 0.487 of 'girl', 0.513 of 'boy'.
realistic_children <- sample(big_girls, size=4, replace=TRUE)
realistic_children
```

But, there is an easier way than compiling a big 1000 element array, and that
is to use the [`prob=`]{.r}[`p=`]{.python} argument to {{< var sample >}}.
This allows us to specify the probability with which we will draw each of the
input elements into the output sample.   For example, to draw 'girl' with
probability 0.487 and 'boy' with probability 0.513, we would do:

```{python}
# Draw 'girl' with probability (p) 0.487 and 'boy' 0.513.
children_again = rnd.choice(['girl', 'boy'], size=4, p=[0.487, 0.513])
children_again
```

```{r}
# Draw 'girl' with probability (p) 0.487 and 'boy' 0.513.
children_again <- sample(c('girl', 'boy'), size=4, prob=c(0.487, 0.513),
                         replace=TRUE)
children_again
```

The [`prob`]{.r}[`p`]{.python} argument allows us to specify the probability of
each element in the input {{< var array >}} â€” so if we had three elements in
the input array, we would need three probabilities in
[`prob`]{.r}[`p`]{.python}.  For example, let's say we were looking at some
poorly-entered hospital records, we might have 'girl' or 'boy' recorded as the
child's gender, but the record might be missing â€” 'not-recorded' â€” with a 19%
chance:

```{python}
# Draw 'girl' with probability (p) 0.4, 'boy' with p=0.41, 'not-recorded' with
# p=0.19.
rnd.choice(['girl', 'boy', 'not-recorded'], size=30, p=[0.4, 0.41, 0.19])
```

```{r}
# Draw 'girl' with probability (p) 0.4, 'boy' with p=0.41, 'not-recorded' with
# p=0.19.
sample(c('girl', 'boy', 'not-recorded'), size=30, prob=c(0.4, 0.41, 0.19),
       replace=TRUE)
```

::: {.callout-note}
## How does the [`prob`]{.r}[`p`]{.python} argument to {{< var sample >}} work?

You might wonder how {{< var lang >}} does this trick of choosing the elements
with different probabilities.

One way of doing this is to use *uniform* random numbers from 0 through 1.
These are floating point numbers that can take any value, at random, from 0
through 1.

```{python}
# Run this cell a few times to see random numbers anywhere from 0 through 1.
rnd.uniform()
```

```{r}
# Run this chunk a few times to see random numbers anywhere from 0 through 1.
# `runif` means "Random UNIForm".
runif(1)
```

Because this random uniform number has an equal chance of being anywhere in the
range 0 through 1, there is a 50% chance that any given number will be less
then 0.5 and a 50% chance it is greater than 0.5. (Of course it could be
*exactly equal to* 0.5, but this is vanishingly unlikely, so we will ignore
that for now).

So, if we thought girls were exactly as likely as boys, we could select from
'girl' and 'boy' using this simple logic:

```{python}
if rnd.uniform() < 0.5:
    result = 'girl'
else:
    result = 'boy'
```

```{r}
if (runif(1) < 0.5) {
    result = 'girl'
} else {
    result = 'boy'
}
```

But, by the same logic, there is a 0.487 chance that the random uniform number
will be less than 0.487 and a 0.513 chance it will be greater.  So, if we
wanted to give ourselves a 0.487 chance of 'girl', we could do:

```{python}
if rnd.uniform() < 0.487:
    result = 'girl'
else:
    result = 'boy'
```

```{r}
if (runif(1) < 0.487) {
    result = 'girl'
} else {
    result = 'boy'
}
```

We can extend the same kind of logic to three options.  For example, there is a
0.4 chance the random uniform number will be less than 0.4, a 0.41 chance it
will be somewhere between 0.4 and 0.81, and a 0.19 chance it will be greater
than 0.81.
:::

## The daughters problem with more accurate probabilities

We can use the probability argument to {{< var sample >}} to do a more
realistic simulation of the chance of a family with exactly three girls.  In
this case it is easy to make the chance for the {{< var lang >}} simulation,
but much more difficult using physical devices like coins to simulate the
randomness.

Remember, the original code for the 50-50 case, has the following:

```{python}
# Select 'girl' or 'boy' at random, four times.
children = rnd.choice(['girl', 'boy'], size=4)

# Count the number of girls and put the result in b.
b = np.sum(children == 'girl')
```

```{r}
# Select 'girl' or 'boy' at random, four times.
children <- sample(c('girl', 'boy'), size=4, replace=TRUE)

# Count the number of girls and put the result in b.
b <- sum(children == 'girl')
```

The only change we need to the above, for the 0.487 - 0.513 case, is the one
you see above:

```{python}
# Give 'girl' 48.7% of the time, 'boy' 51.3% of the time.
children = rnd.choice(['girl', 'boy'], size=4, p=[0.487, 0.513])

b = np.sum(children == 'girl')
```

```{r}
# Give 'girl' 48.7% of the time, 'boy' 51.3% of the time.
children <- sample(c('girl', 'boy'), size=4, prob=c(0.487, 0.513),
                   replace=TRUE)

# Count the number of girls and put the result in b.
b <- sum(children == 'girl')
```

The rest of the program remains unchanged.

## A note on clarifying and labeling problems

In conventional analytic texts and courses on inferential statistics,
students are taught to distinguish between various classes of problems
in order to decide which formula to apply. I doubt the wisdom of
categorizing and labeling problems in that fashion, and the practice is
unnecessary here. I consider it better that the student think through
every new problem in the most fundamental terms. The exercise of this
basic thinking avoids the mistakes that come from too-hasty and
superficial pigeon-holing of problems into categories. Nevertheless, in
order to help readers connect up the resampling material with the
conventional curriculum of analytic methods, the examples presented here
are given their conventional labels. And the examples given here cover
the range of problems encountered in courses in probability and
inferential statistics.

To repeat, one does not need to classify a problem when one proceeds
with the Monte Carlo resampling method; you simply model the features of
the situation you wish to analyze. In contrast, with conventional
methods you must classify the situation and then apply procedures
according to rules that depend upon the classification; often the
decision about which rules to follow must be messy because
classification is difficult in many cases, which contributes to the
difficulty of choosing correct conventional formulaic methods.

## Binomial trials

The problem of the three daughters in four births is known in the conventional
literature as a "binomial sampling experiment with equally-likely outcomes."
"Binomial" means that the *individual* simple event (a birth or a coin flip)
can have only *two outcomes* (boy or girl, heads or tails), "binomial" meaning
"two names" in Latin.[^binomial]

[^binomial]: Conventional labels such as "binomial" are used here for general
    background and as guideposts to orient the student of conventional
    statistics. You do not need to know these labels to understand the
    resampling approach; one of the advantages of resampling is that it avoids
    errors resulting from incorrect pigeonholing of problems.

A fundamental property of binomial processes is that the individual trials are
*independent*, a concept discussed earlier. A binomial sampling process is a
*series* of binomial (one-of-two-outcome) events about which one may ask many
sorts of questions â€” the probability of exactly X heads ("successes") in N
trials, or the probability of X or more "successes" in N trials, and so on.

"Equally likely outcomes" means we assume that the probability of a girl or boy
in any one birth is the same (though this assumption is slightly contrary to
fact); we represent this assumption with the equal-probability heads and tails
of a coin. Shortly we will come to binomial sampling experiments where the
probabilities of the individual outcomes are *not* equal.

The term "with replacement" was explained earlier; if we were to use a
deck of red and black cards (instead of a coin) for this resampling
experiment, we would *replace* the card each time a card is drawn.

The introductory poker example from @sec-one-pair, illustrated sampling without
replacement, as will other examples to follow.

This problem would be done conventionally with the binomial theorem using
probabilities of .5, or of .487 and .513, asking about 3 successes in 4 trials.

## Example: Three or More Successful Basketball Shots in Five Attempts

This is an example of two-outcome sampling with unequally-likely outcomes, with
replacement â€” a binomial experiment.

What is the probability that a basketball player will score three or
more baskets in five shots from a spot 30 feet from the basket, if on
the average she succeeds with 25 percent of her shots from that spot?

In this problem the probabilities of "success" or "failure" are not
equal, in contrast to the previous problem of the daughters. Instead of
a 50-50 coin, then, an appropriate "model" would be a thumbtack that has
a 25 percent chance of landing "up" when it falls, and a 75 percent
chance of landing down.

If we lack a thumbtack known to have a 25 percent chance of landing
"up," we could use a card deck and let spades equal "success" and the
other three suits represent "failure." Our resampling experiment could
then be done as follows:

1.  Let "spade" stand for "successful shot," and the other suits stand
    for unsuccessful shot.
2.  Draw a card, record its suit ("spade" or "other") and replace. Do so five
    times (for five shots).
3.  Record whether the outcome of step 2 was three or more spades. If so
    indicate "yes," and otherwise "no."
4.  Repeat steps 2-4 perhaps four hundred times.
5.  Count the proportion "yes" out of the four hundred throws. That
    proportion estimates the probability of getting three or more
    baskets out of five shots if the probability of a single basket is
    .25.

The first four repetitions on your score sheet might look like this
(@tbl-three-shots):

| Card 1 | Card 2 | Card 3 | Card 4 | Card 5 | Result |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Spade  | Other  | Other  | Other  | Other  | No     |

: First four repetitions of 3 or more shots simulation {#tbl-three-shots}

Instead of cards, we could have used two-digit random numbers, with
(say) "1-25" standing for "success," and "26-00" ("00" in place of
"100") standing for failure. Then the steps would simply be:

1.  Let the random numbers "1-25" stand for "successful shot,"
    "26-00" for unsuccessful shot.
2.  Draw five random numbers;
3.  Count how many of the numbers are between "01" and "25." If
    three or more, score "yes."
4.  Repeat step 2 four hundred times.

If you understand the earlier "three_girls" program, then the program below
should be easy: To create 10000 samples, we start with a `for` statement. We
then sample 5 numbers between "1" and "4" into our variable `a` to simulate the
5 shots, each with a 25 percent â€” or 1 in 4 â€” chance of scoring. We decide that
1 will stand for a successful shot, and 2 through 4 will stand for a missed
shot, and therefore we count (`sum`) the number of 1's in `a` to determine the
number of shots resulting in baskets in the current sample. The next step is to
transfer the results of each trial to {{< var array >}} `n_baskets`. We then
finish the loop [by unindenting the next line of code]{.python}[with the `}`
close brace]{.r}. The final step is to search the {{< var array >}}
`n_baskets`, after the 10000 samples have been generated and `sum` the times
that 3 or more baskets were made. We place the results in `n_more_than_2`,
calculate the proportion in `propo_more_than_2`, and then display the result.

## Note to the student of analytic probability theory

This problem would be done conventionally with the binomial theorem,
asking about the chance of getting 3 successes in 5 trials, with the
probability of a success = .25.

## Example: One in Black, Two in White, No Misses in Three Archery Shots {#sec-one-black-archery}

This is an example of a multiple outcome (*multinomial*) sampling with
unequally likely outcomes; with replacement.

Assume from past experience that a given archer puts 10 percent of his
shots in the black ("bullseye") and 60 percent of his shots in the white
ring around the bullseye, but misses with 30 percent of his shots. How
likely is it that in three shots the shooter will get exactly one
bullseye, two in the white, and no misses? Notice that unlike the
previous cases, in this example there are more than two outcomes for
each trial.

This problem may be handled with a deck of three colors (or suits) of
cards in proportions varying according to the probabilities of the
various outcomes, and sampling with replacement. Using random numbers is
simpler, however:

* **Step 1.** Let "1" = "bullseye," "2-7" = "in the white," and "8-0" = "miss."
* **Step 2.** Choose three random numbers, and examine whether there are one
  "1" and two numbers "2-7." If so, record "yes," otherwise "no."
* **Step 3.** Repeat step 2 perhaps 400 times, and count the proportion of
  "yeses." This estimates the probability sought.

This problem would be handled in conventional probability theory with what is
known as the *Multinomial Distribution*.

This problem may be quickly solved on the computer using {{< var lang >}}
with the notebook labeled "bullseye" below. Bullseye has a complication not
found in previous problems: It tests whether two different sorts of events
*both* happen â€” a bullseye plus two shots in the white.

After generating three randomly-drawn numbers between 1 and 10, we check
with the `sum` function to see if there is a bullseye. If there is, the `if`
statement tells the computer to continue with the operations, checking if there
are two shots in the white; if there is no bullseye, the `if` statement tells
the computer to end the trial and start another trial. A thousand repetitions
are called for, the number of trials meeting the criteria are counted, and the
results are then printed.

In addition to showing how this particular problem may be handled with
{{< var lang >}}, the "bullseye" program teaches you some more
fundamentals of computer programming. The `if` statement and the two loops, one
within the other, are basic tools of programming.

This example illustrates the addition rule that was introduced and discussed in
@sec-prob-theory-one-b. In @sec-one-black-archery, a bullseye, an in-the-white
shot, and a missed shot are "mutually exclusive" events because a single shot
cannot result in more than one of the three possible outcomes. One can
calculate the probability of *either of two* mutually-exclusive outcomes by
adding their probabilities. The probability of *either* a bullseye or a shot in
the white is .1 + .6 = .7. The probability of an arrow *either* in the white
*or* a miss is .6 + .3 = .9. The logic of the addition rule is obvious when we
examine the random numbers given to the outcomes. Seven of 10 random numbers
belong to "bullseye" or "in the white," and nine of 10 belong to "in the white"
or "miss."

## Example: Two Groups of Heart Patients

We want to learn how likely it is that, by chance, group A would have as little
as two deaths more than group B â€” @tbl-two-heart-groups:

          Live       Die
--------- ---------- ---------
Group A   79         11
Group B   21         9
--------- ---------- ---------

: Two Groups of Heart Patients {#tbl-two-heart-groups}

This problem, phrased here as a question in probability, is the prototype of a
problem in statistics that we will consider later (which the conventional
theory would handle with a "chi square distribution"). We can handle it in
either of two ways, as follows:

**Approach A**

1. Put 120 balls into a bucket, 100 white (for live) and 20 black (for die).
2. Draw 30 balls randomly and assign them to Group B; the others are assigned
   to group A.
3. Count the numbers of black balls in the two groups and determine whether
   Group A's excess "deaths" (= black balls), compared to Group B, is two or
   fewer (or what is equivalent in this case, whether there are 11 or fewer
   black balls in Group A); if so, write "Yes," otherwise "No."
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 perhaps 10000 times and compute the proportion "Yes."

A second way we shall think about this sort of problem may be handled as
follows:

**Approach B**

1. Put 120 balls into a bucket, 100 white (for live) and 20 black (for die) (as
   before).
2. Draw balls one by one, replacing the drawn ball each time, until you have
   accumulated 90 balls for Group A and 30 balls for Group B. (You could, of
   course, just as well use a bucket for 4 white and 1 black balls or 8 white
   and 2 black in this approach.)
3. As in approach "A" above, count the numbers of black balls in the two groups
   and determine whether Group A's excess deaths is two or fewer; if so, write
   "Yes," otherwise "No."
4. As above, repeat steps 2 and 3 perhaps 10000 times and compute the
   proportion "Yes."

We must also take into account the possibility of a similar eye-catching
"unbalanced" result of a much larger proportion of deaths in Group B. It will
be a tough decision how to do so, but a reasonable option is to simply double
the probability computed in step 4a or 4b.

Deciding which of these two approaches â€” the "permutation" (without
replacement) and "bootstrap" (with replacement) methods â€” is the more
appropriate is often a thorny matter; it will be discussed latter in
@sec-testing-measured. In many cases, however, the two approaches will lead to
similar results.

Later, we will actually carry out these procedures with the aid of
{{< var lang >}}, and estimate the probabilities we seek.

## Example: Dispersion of a Sum of Random Variables â€” Hammer Lengths â€” Heads and Handles

The distribution of lengths for hammer *handles* is as follows: 20 percent are
10 inches long, 30 percent are 10.1 inches, 30 percent are 10.2 inches, and 20
percent are 10.3 inches long. The distribution of lengths for hammer *heads* is
as follows: 2.0 inches, 20 percent; 2.1 inches, 20 percent; 2.2 inches, 30
percent; 2.3 inches, 20 percent; 2.4 inches, 10 percent.

If you draw a handle and a head at random, what will be the mean total length?
In @sec-prob-theory-one-b we saw that the conventional formulaic method tells
you that an answer with a formula that says the sum of the means is the mean of
the sums, but it is easy to get the answer with simulation. But now we ask
about the *dispersion* of the sum. There are formulaic rules for such measures
as the variance. But consider this other example: What proportion of the
hammers made with handles and heads drawn at random will have lengths equal to
or greater than 12.4 inches? No simple formula will provide an answer. And if
the number of categories is increased considerably, any formulaic approach will
be become burdensome if not undoable. But Monte Carlo simulation produces an
answer quickly and easily, as follows:

1.  Fill a bucket with:

    * 2 balls marked "10" (inches),
    * 3 balls marked "10.1",
    * 3 marked "10.2", and
    * 2 marked "10.3".

    This bucket represents the handles.

    Fill another bucket with:

    * 2 balls marked "2.0",
    * 2 balls marked "2.1",
    * 3 balls marked "2.2",
    * 2 balls marked "2.3" and
    * 1 ball marked "2.4".

    This bucket represents the heads.

2.  Pick a ball from each of the "handles" and "heads" bucket, calculate the
    sum, and replace the balls.

3.  Repeat perhaps 200 times (more when you write a computer program), and
    calculate the proportion of the sums that are greater than 12.4 inches.

You may also want to forego learning the standard "rule," and simply estimate
the mean this way, also. As an exercise, compute the interquartile range â€” the
difference between the 25th and the 75th percentiles.

## Example: The Product of Random Variables â€” Theft by Employees

The distribution of the number of thefts per month you can expect in your
business is as follows:

Number       Probability
------------ -----------------
0            0.5
1            0.2
2            0.1
3            0.1
4            0.1
------------ -----------------

The amounts that may be stolen on any theft are as follows:

Amount       Probability
------------ -----------------
\$50         0.4
\$75         0.4
\$100        0.1
\$125        0.1
------------ -----------------

The same procedure as used above to estimate the mean length of hammers â€” add
the lengths of handles and heads â€” can be used for this problem except that the
results of the drawings from each bucket are multiplied rather than added.

In this case there is again a simple rule: The mean of the products equals the
product of the means. But this rule holds only when the two urns are indeed
independent of each other, as they are in this case.

The next two problems are a bit harder than the previous ones; you might skip
them for now and come back to them a bit later. However, with the Monte Carlo
simulation method they are within the grasp of any introductory student who has
had just a bit of experience with the method. In contrast, a standard book
whose lead author is Frederick Mosteller, as respected a statistician as there
is, says of this type of problem: "Naturally, in this book we cannot expect to
study such difficult problems in their full generality \[that is, show how to
solve them, rather than merely state them\], but we can lay a foundation for
their study." [@mosteller1961probability, page 5]

## Example: Flipping Pennies to the End

Two players, each with a stake of ten pennies, engage in the following
game: A coin is tossed, and if it is (say) heads, player A gives player B a
penny; if it is tails, player B gives player A a penny. What is the probability
that one player will lose his or her entire stake of 10 pennies if they play
for 200 tosses?

This is a classic problem in probability theory; it has many everyday
applications in situations such as inventory management. For example, what is
the probability of going out of stock of a given item in a given week if
customers and deliveries arrive randomly? It also is a model for many processes
in modern particle physics.

Solution of the penny-matching problem with coins is straightforward.
Repeatedly flip a coin and check if one player or the other reaches a zero
balance before you reach 200 flips. Or with random numbers:

1. Numbers "1-5" = head = "+1"; Numbers "6-0" = tail = "-1."
2. Proceed down a series of 200 numbers, keeping a running tally of the "+1"'s
   and the "-1"'s. If the tally reaches "+10" or "-10" on or before the
   two-hundredth digit, record "yes"; otherwise record "no."
3. Repeat step 2 perhaps 400 or 10000 times, and calculate the proportion of
   "yeses." This estimates the probability sought.

The following {{< var lang >}} program also solves the problem. The heart of
the program starts at the line where the program models a coin flip with the
statement:
[`c = rnd.integers(1, 3)`]{.python}
[`c = sample(1:2, size=1)`]{.r}
After you study that, go back and notice the inner `for` loop starting with
[`for j in range(200):`]{.python}
[`for (j in 1:200) {`]{.r}
that describes the procedure for flipping a coin 200 times. Finally, note how
the outer
[`for i in range(10000):`]{.python}
[`for (i in 1:10000) {`]{.r}
loop simulates 10000 games, each game consisting of the 200 coin flips we
generated with the inner `for` loop above.

## Example: A Drunk's Random Walk

If a drunk chooses the direction of each step randomly, will he ever get home?
If he can only walk on the road on which he lives, the problem is almost the
same as the gambler's-ruin problem above ("pennies"). But if the drunk can go
north-south as well as east-west, the problem becomes a bit different and

Looking now at @fig-drunk-walk â€” what is the probability of the drunk reaching
*either* his house (at 3 steps east, 2 steps north) *or* my house (1 west, 4
south) before he finishes taking twelve steps?

One way to handle the problem would be to use a four-directional spinner such
as is used with a child's board game, and then keep track of each step on a
piece of graph paper. The reader may construct a {{< var lang >}} program as an
exercise.

```{r fig-drunk-walk, opts.label="svg_fig", fig.cap="Drunk random walk"}

```

## Example: public and private liquor pricing {#sec-public-liquor}

Let's end this chapter with an actual example that will be used again in
@sec-finite-universes when discussing probability in finite universes, and then
at great length in the context of statistics in @sec-testing-measured. This
example also illustrates the close connection between problems in pure
probability and those in statistical inference.

As of 1963, there were 26 U.S. states in whose liquor systems the retail liquor
stores are privately owned, and 16 "monopoly" states where the state government
owns the retail liquor stores. (Some states were omitted for technical
reasons.) These were the representative 1961 prices of a fifth of Seagram 7
Crown whiskey in the two sets of states (@tbl-whiskey-prices):

```{python echo=FALSE, results="asis", eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
import liquor_analysis as la
print(f'{la.md_table()}\n\n: '
      'Whiskey prices by state category {#tbl-whiskey-prices}')
```

```{python fig-whiskey-hist, opts.label="svg_fig", fig.cap="Whiskey prices by state category"}
la.price_plots()
```

Let us consider that all these states' prices constitute one single universe
(an assumption whose justification will be discussed later). If so, one can
ask: If these 42 states constitute a single universe, how likely is it that one
would choose two samples at random, containing 16 and 26 observations, that
would have prices as different as \$.49 (the difference between the means that
was actually observed)?

This can be thought of as problem in pure probability because we begin
with a known universe and ask how it would behave with random drawings
from it. We sample *with replacement* ; the decision to do so, rather
than to sample without replacement (which is the way I had first done
it, and for which there may be better justification) will be discussed
later. We do so to introduce a "bootstrap"-type procedure (defined
later) as follows: Write each of the forty-two observed state prices on
a separate card. The shuffled deck simulated a situation in which each
state has an equal chance for each price. Repeatedly deal groups of 16
and 26 cards, replacing the cards as they are chosen, to simulate
hypothetical monopoly-state and private-state samples. For each trial,
calculate the difference in mean prices.

These are the steps systematically:

* **Step A:** Write each of the 42 prices on a card and shuffle.
* **Steps B and C** (combined in this case): i) Draw cards randomly with
  replacement into groups of 16 and 26 cards. Then ii) calculate the mean price
  difference between the groups, and iii) compare the simulation-trial
  difference to the observed mean difference of \$4.84 - \$4.35 = \$.49; if it
  is as great or greater than \$.49, write "yes," otherwise "no."
* **Step D:** Repeat step B-C a hundred or a thousand times. Calculate the
  proportion "yes," which estimates the probability we seek.

The probability that the postulated universe would produce a difference between
groups as large or larger than observed in 1961 is estimated by how frequently
the mean of the group of randomly-chosen sixteen prices from the simulated
state-ownership universe is less than (or equal to) the mean of the actual
sixteen state-ownership prices. The following notebook performs the operations
described above.

### Concatenating {{< var array >}}s {#sec-concatenate}

Before we start the simulation, we need a little extra {{< var np_or_r >}} machinery.

In what follows, we are going to make {{< var an_array >}} for the 26
*private* prices, and another {{< var array >}} for the 16 *government*
prices, and then concatenate these two {{< var array >}}s to make a new {{< var array >}} with 26 + 16 = 42 elements, where the first 26 elements are the private prices and the last 16 elements are the government prices.

You will see that in action below, but this is what that *concatenation* looks
like in {{< var np_or_r >}} for some example {{< var array >}}s.

::: python
We use Numpy's `concatenate` function to concatenate two arrays:
:::

```{python}
arr_a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
arr_b = np.array([10, 11, 12, 13])
# Use np.concatenate function to make new array consisting of elements in
# first array followed by elements in second array.
both = np.concatenate([arr_a, arr_b])
# Show the result.
both
```

::: r
We have already seen R's concatenation function in action.  It is the function named `c`.  For example, we use `c(1, 2, 3)` to *concatenate* the single numbers 1, 2, and 3 into a combined (concatenated) *vector* with elements 1, 2, 3:

```{r}
vec_a <- c(1, 2, 3)
vec_a
```

We can also use the `c` function to concatenate *vectors*:

```{r}
vec_b <- c(10, 11, 12, 13)
# Use the "c" function to make new vector consisting of elements in
# first vector followed by elements in second vector.
both <- c(vec_a, vec_b)
# Show the result.
both
```

### Plotting histograms {#sec-on-histograms}

The other procedure we will use for the simulation, is graphing the results
with a *histogram*.

::: {.notebook name="on_histograms" title="Plotting histograms"}

A histogram is a visual way to show the *distribution* of a sequence of values.

::: python

We now enter the world of *plotting* in Python.  As Numpy is a Python library
for working with arrays, Matplotlib is a library for making and showing plots.

To use the Numpy library, we `import` it.   As you have seen, the usual
convention is to make the standard `numpy` library name easier to read and
type, by renaming the library to `np` on `import`, like this:

```{python}
# Import numpy library and rename to "np"
import numpy as np
```

In a similar way, we need to import the Matplotlib library.  In fact we will be
using a particular part of the Matplotlib library, called `pyplot`.

We use the following standard convention to import the `pyplot` part of the
Matplotlib library and give it the shorter name of `plt`:

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

:::{#nte-modules-submodules .callout-note}
## Modules and submodules

We have been calling Numpy and Matlotlib *libraries*, but technically,
Python calls these *modules*.  Modules are collections of code and data that
you can `import` into Python.  For example, Numpy (now renamed as `np`) is
a module:

```{python}
# Show type for the import Numpy module (renamed as "np").
type(np)
```

We can get elements contained in (attached to) a module using the `.` syntax.
For example, here we get the value of the `pi` variable, attached to the Numpy
module.

```{python}
# Get and show the value of the variable "pi" attached to (contained within)
# the Numpy module.
np.pi
```

One type of thing a module can contain, is other modules.  These
modules-attached-to-modules are called *submodules*.  Perhaps without knowing,
you have already used the `random` submodule attached to the Numpy module:

```{python}
# "random" is itself a module, attached to (contained within) the Numpy
# module.  It is therefore a "submodule" of Numpy.
type(np.random)
```

We used the `default_rng` function from the `random` submodule to create random
number generators:

```{python}
rng = np.random.default_rng()
```

`pyplot` is a submodule of Matplotlib.

```{python}
# Reimport the module to remind ourselves of the import line.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# plt is a new name we have set for the "pyplot" submodule of Matplotlib.
type(plt)
```

The `pyplot` submodule of Matplotlib has many useful functions for making and
displaying plots.

The easiest way to explain histograms is to show one.

Let's start with a sequence of values we are interested in:

Here are the 24 values for whiskey prices in states that did not have a liquor
monopoly (`priv`).

```{python}
priv = np.array([
    4.82, 5.29, 4.89, 4.95, 4.55, 4.90, 5.25, 5.30, 4.29, 4.85, 4.54, 4.75,
    4.85, 4.85, 4.50, 4.75, 4.79, 4.85, 4.79, 4.95, 4.95, 4.75, 5.20, 5.10,
    4.80, 4.29])
```

```{r}
priv <- c(4.82, 5.29, 4.89, 4.95, 4.55, 4.90, 5.25, 5.30, 4.29, 4.85, 4.54,
          4.75, 4.85, 4.85, 4.50, 4.75, 4.79, 4.85, 4.79, 4.95, 4.95, 4.75,
          5.20, 5.10, 4.80, 4.29)
```

These are the 16 values for states with a liquor monopoly (`govt`):

```{python}
govt = np.array([
    4.65, 4.55, 4.11, 4.15, 4.20, 4.55, 3.80, 4.00, 4.19, 4.75, 4.74, 4.50,
    4.10, 4.00, 5.05, 4.20])
```

```{r}
govt <- c(4.65, 4.55, 4.11, 4.15, 4.20, 4.55, 3.80, 4.00, 4.19, 4.75, 4.74,
          4.50, 4.10, 4.00, 5.05, 4.20)
```

We concatenate these values to get a sequence ({{< var an_array >}}) of all 40
liquor prices:

```{python}
prices = np.concatenate([priv, govt])
prices
```

```{r}
prices <- c(priv, govt)
prices
```

We are interested in the distribution of these 40 values.  To show the distribution, we can make and show a histogram of these prices, using the
[`hist` function attached to the `plt` submodule]{.python}
[`hist` function in R]{.r}.

```{python}
hist_res = plt.hist(prices)
```

```{r}
hist_res <- hist(prices)
```

[`plt.hist`]{.python}[`hist`]{.r} has calculated {{< var an_array >}} of
suitable intervals (*bins*) to divide up the range of values, and then counted
how many values in `prices` fall into each interval (bin).

You will notice that [`plt.hist`]{.python}[`hist`]{.r} has sent back some
results from the process of making the histogram. [In fact, the results are in
the form of a list.]{.python}

The first result of interest to us is the definition of the intervals (bins)
into which the histogram has divided the range of `prices` values.

::: python

In fact, `plt.hist` sent back the edges of these bins in the second element of
`hist_res`:

```{python}
# The second element in the results list is the array of bin edges.
bin_edges = hist_res[1]
bin_edges
```

Think of this array as the 10 values that start each of the 10 bins, followed
by a final value that ends the final bin.

This means that the first bin was from (including) 3.8 up to, but not including
3.95, the second bin was from (including) 3.95 up to, but not including 4.1 and
so on.   The last bin is from (including) 5.15 through (including) 5.3.  Notice
there are 11 edges, forming 10 bins.

Put another way, the edges that `plt.hist` sent back are the 10 left hand
(inclusive) edges of the 10 bins, and a final right hand (inclusive) edge of
the final (10^th^) bin.

The first element that comes back in the list of results is the array of counts
of the values in `prices` that fall within each bin.

```{python}
# The first element in the results list is the counts of values falling into
# each bin.
counts = hist_res[0]
counts
```

The values tell us that 1 value from `prices` fell in the range 3.8 up to (not
including) 3.95 (were within the first bin), 2 values fell in the range 3.95 up
to (not including) 4.1, and so on.

That the counts correspond to the heights of the bars on the histogram, so the
first bar has height 1, the second bar has height 2, and so on.

By default, `plt.hist` assumes you want 10 bins, and uses its default method of
calculation to work out the edges for those 10 bins.  You can specify another
number of bins, by sending a number to the `bins` argument of `plt.hist`.  For
example, you might want 20 bins:

```{python}
results_20 = plt.hist(prices, bins=20)
```

We now have 21 new edge values, the first 20 values giving the (inclusive)
left-hand edges, and the last giving the (inclusive) right hand edge of the
last bin.

```{python}
bin_edges_20 = results_20[1]
bin_edges_20
```

We can also specify our own edges, in order to bypass `plt.hist`s default
algorithm to calculate edges.  For example, we might prefer 16 bins of width
0.1, starting at 3.8, giving edges like this:

```{python}
our_edges = 3.8 + np.arange(16) * 0.1
our_edges
```

We can send these directly to `plt.hist` to set the edges:

```{python}
results_16 = plt.hist(prices, bins=our_edges)
# Show the edges that come back (these are the edges we sent).
results_16[1]
```

If you are running the notebook interactively in Jupyter, running `plt.hist` on
its own, as below, will show the values as the result of the cell, along with
the plot.  (You won't see these results displayed in the textbook, because we
use different software to show outputs when we build the textbook).

```{python}
# If we don't collect the results, Jupyter shows them to us,
# if this is the last expression in the cell.
# (You won't see the results displayed in the textbook).
plt.hist(prices)
```

Interactive Jupyter will display the returned list of results, because we have
not collected the results by assigning them to a variable.  More technically,
on its own, the `plt.hist` line is an *expression* (code that results in
a value), and Jupyter will, by default, display the results of an expression
that ends the code in a cell.

::: nb-only
Here we see that the result of the `plt.hist(prices)` expression is a list with
three elements.  As you saw before, the first element is the array with the
counts for each of the (by default) 10 bins.  The second is the array with the
bin edges (10 left edges and last right edge).  The last is a reference to the
values that make up the graphical display; you can use this last value to do
some advanced configuration of the histogram display, but we won't cover that
further in this book.
:::

It can be distracting to see a display of the results list from a plotting
cell, so from now on we will suppress Jupyter's default behavior of displaying
the results list from `plt.hist`, by adding a semi-colon at the end of the code
line, as in the cell below. (Remember, in the textbook, but not in Jupyter,
this will give the same result as `plt.hist(prices)` above, because of the
display system we use for the textbook.)

```{python}
plt.hist(prices);  # Note the semi-colon
```

The semi-colon is a standard indicator to Jupyter that it should not display
the results that came back from the function call.   We will use it to suppress
the display of various values that come back from these functions, as they are
usually not of immediate interest.

:::
<!---
End Python section.

::: r

In fact, `hist` sent back the edges (or *breaks*) of these bins as part of the
`hist_res` results.  `hist_res` is a special R value to contain the results of
the histogram.  It contains various relevant values.


```{r}
hist_res
```

Notice that the values attached to the `hist_res` result have *names*, such as
`breaks`, `counts` and so on.   To get the attached values from the `hist_res` results, we use the `$` character to mean *attached to*.  So read:

```{r}
hist_res$counts
```

as "get the value called `counts` that is attached to the `hist_res` value."

When we called `hist(prices)`, the `hist` function had to decide how many bins
to use, and the edges of the bins.  By default, it does this with an algorithm
called [Sturge's rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturges%27s_rule).  The
details of the algorithm are not important to us, but the result is that `hist`
decided to make 9 bins, with the edges you see in the `breaks` value of
`hist_res`.

```{r}
# Bin edges
hist_res$breaks
```

Think of the `breaks` values as: the value that starts the first bin, followed
by the 9 values that end each of the 9 bins.

The `breaks` vector shows that the first bin was from (including) 3.8 up to,
*and including* 4.0, the second bin was from (not including) 4.0 up to, and
including 4.2 and so on. The last bin is from (not including) 5.2 through
(including) 5.4.  There are 10 edges (breaks), forming 9 bins.[^r-hist-right]

[^r-hist-right]: You can customize the calculation and meaning of the `breaks`
    values using various arguments to the `hist` function.  See the
    documentation of `hist` for more details.

Put another way, the edges (boundaries) that `hist` sent back start with the
left-hand (inclusive) edge of the first bin, followed by the 9 right-hand
(inclusive) edges of the 9 bins.

The list of results in `hist_res` includes the vector of *counts* of values in
`prices` that fall within each bin.

```{r}
# Counts of values falling into each bin.
hist_res$counts
```

The `counts` vector shows that 3 values from `prices` fell in the range 3.8
through 4.0, 6 values fell in the range from (not including) 4.0 through 4.2,
and so on.

The counts correspond to the heights of the bars on the histogram, so the first
bar has height 3, the second bar has height 6, and so on.

By default, `hist` uses Sturge's rule to decide on the number of bins.  You can
also *suggest* to R that it uses another number of bins, by sending a number
for the `breaks` argument to `hist`.  For example, you might want to suggest 20
bins:

```{r}
results_20 <- hist(prices, breaks=20)
```

Notice that R treats this number as a suggestion, and will adjust the actual
number of bins to something close to the suggestion and that result in suitably
rounded bin edges.   In fact, R responded to the suggestion of 20 by giving 15
bins:

```{r}
length(results_20$counts)
```

We now have 16 new edges (boundaries), the first value giving the (inclusive)
left-hand edge of the first bin, and the subsequent 15 values giving the
(inclusive) right-hand edges.

```{r}
results_20$breaks
```

We can also specify our own `breaks`, in order to bypass `hist`s default
algorithm.  For example, we might prefer exactly 16 bins of size 0.1, with
edges starting at 3.8:

```{r}
our_edges <- 3.8 + 0:15 * 0.1
our_edges
```

We can send these directly to `hist` to specify the edges (and the number of
bins):

```{r}
results_16 = hist(prices, breaks=our_edges)
```

```{r}
# Show the edges that come back (these are the edges we sent).
results_16$breaks
```

:::

The results shown above â€” not even one "success" in 10,000 trials â€” imply
that there is only a very small probability that two groups with mean
prices as different as were observed would happen by chance if drawn
with replacement from the universe of 42 observed prices.

Here we think of these states as if they came from a non-finite
universe, which is one possible interpretation for one particular
context. However, in @sec-finite-universes we will postulate a finite universe,
which is appropriate if it is reasonable to consider that these
observations constitute the entire universe (aside from those states
excluded from the analysis because of data complexities).

## The general procedure

@sec-testing-procedures generalizes what we have done in the probability
problems above into a general procedure, which will in turn be a subpart of a
general procedure for all of resampling.
