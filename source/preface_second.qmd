## Brief history of the resampling method {#sec-brief-history}

This book describes a revolutionary — but now fully accepted — approach
to probability and statistics. Monte Carlo resampling simulation takes
the mumbo-jumbo out of statistics and enables even beginning students to
understand completely everything that is done.

Before we go further, let's make the discussion more concrete with an
example. Ask a class: What are the chances that three of a family's
first four children will be girls? After various entertaining class
suggestions about procreating four babies, or surveying families with
four children, someone in the group always suggests flipping a coin.
This leads to valuable student discussion about whether the probability
of a girl is exactly half (there are about 105 males born for each 100
females), whether .5 is a satisfactory approximation, whether four coins
flipped once give the same answer as one coin flipped four times, and so
on. Soon the class decides to take actual samples of coin flips. And
students see that this method quickly arrives at estimates that are
accurate enough for most purposes. Discussion of what is "accurate
enough" also comes up, and that discussion is valuable, too.

The Monte Carlo method itself is not new. Near the end of World War II,
a group of physicists at the Rand Corp. began to use random-number
simulations to study processes too complex to handle with formulas. The
name "Monte Carlo" came from the analogy to the gambling houses on the
French Riviera. The application of Monte Carlo methods in *teaching*
statistics also is not new. Simulations have often been used to
illustrate basic concepts. What *is* new and radical is using Monte
Carlo methods routinely as problem-solving tools for everyday problems
in probability and statistics.

From here on, the related term *resampling* will be used throughout the
book. Resampling refers to the use of the observed data or of a data
generating mechanism (such as a die) to produce new hypothetical
samples, the results of which can then be analyzed. The term
*computer-intensive methods* also is frequently used to refer to
techniques such as these.

The history of resampling is as follows: In the mid-1960's, I noticed
that most graduate students — among them many who had had several
advanced courses in statistics — were unable to apply statistical
methods correctly in their social science research. I sympathized with
them. Even many experts are unable to understand intuitively the formal
mathematical approach to the subject. Clearly, we need a method free of
the formulas that bewilder almost everyone.

The solution is as follows: Beneath the logic of a statistical inference
there necessarily lies a physical process. The resampling methods
described in this book allow us to work directly with the underlying
physical model by simulating it, rather than describing it with
formulae. This general insight is also the heart of the specific
technique Bradley Efron felicitously labeled 'the bootstrap'
[-@efron1982jackknife], a device I introduced in 1969 that is now the most
commonly used, and best known, resampling method.

The resampling approach was first tried with graduate students in 1966,
and it worked exceedingly well. Next, under the auspices of the father
of the "new math," Max Beberman, I "taught" the method to a class of
high school seniors in 1967. The word "taught" is in quotation marks
because the pedagogical essence of the resampling approach is that the
students discover the method for themselves with a minimum of explicit
instruction from the teacher.

The first classes were a success and the results were published in 1969
[@simon1969new]. Three PhD experiments were then conducted under Kenneth
Travers' supervision, and they all showed overwhelming superiority for the
resampling method [@simon1976probability]. Subsequent research has confirmed
this success.

The method was first presented at some length in the 1969 edition of my book
*Basic Research Methods in Social Science* [@simon1969basic] (third edition
with Paul Burstein -@simon1985basic).

For some years, the resampling method failed to ignite interest among
statisticians. While many factors (including the accumulated
intellectual and emotional investment in existing methods) impede the
adoption of any new technique, the lack of readily available computing
power and tools was an obstacle. (The advent of the personal computer in
the 1980s changed that, of course.)

Then in the late 1970s, Efron began to publish formal analyses of the
bootstrap — an important resampling application. Interest among
statisticians has exploded since then, in conjunction with the
availability of easy, fast, and inexpensive computer simulations. The
bootstrap has been the most widely used, but across-the-board
application of computer intensive methods now seems at hand. As
@noreen1989computer noted, "there is a computer-intensive alternative to just
about every conventional parametric and nonparametric test." And the bootstrap
method has now been hailed by an official *American Statistical Association*
volume as the only "great breakthrough" in statistics since 1970 [@kotz1992breakthroughs].

It seems appropriate now to offer the resampling method as the technique
of choice for beginning students as well as for the advanced
practitioners who have been exploring and applying the method.

Though the term "computer-intensive methods" is nowadays used to
describe the techniques elaborated here, this book can be read either
with or without the accompanying use of the computer. However, as a
practical matter, users of these methods are unlikely to be content with
manual simulations if a quick and simple computer-program alternative
is available.

The ultimate test of the resampling method is how well you, the reader,
learn it and like it. But knowing about the experiences of others may
help beginners as well as experienced statisticians approach the scary
subject of statistics with a good attitude. Students as early as junior
high school, taught by a variety of instructors and in other languages
as well as English, have — in a matter of 6 or 12 short hours — learned
how to handle problems that students taught conventionally do not learn
until advanced university courses. And several controlled experimental
studies show that, on average, students who learn this method are more
likely to arrive at correct solutions than are students who are taught
conventional methods.

Best of all, the experiments comparing the resampling method against
conventional methods show that students *enjoy* learning statistics and
probability this way, and they don't suffer statistics panic. This
experience contrasts sharply with the reactions of students learning by
conventional methods. (This is true even when the same teachers teach
both methods as part of an experiment.)

A public offer: The intellectual history of probability and statistics
began with gambling games and betting. Therefore, perhaps a lighthearted
but very serious offer would not seem inappropriate here: I hereby
publicly offer to stake \$5,000 in a contest against any teacher of
conventional statistics, with the winner to be decided by whose students
get the larger number of simple and complex numerical problems correct,
when teaching similar groups of students for a limited number of class
hours — say, six or ten. And if I should win, as I am confident that I
will, I will contribute the winnings to the effort to promulgate this
teaching method. (Here it should be noted that I am far from being the
world's most skillful or charming teacher. It is the subject matter that
does the job, not the teacher's excellence.) This offer has been in
print for many years now, but no one has accepted it.

The early chapters of the book contain considerable discussion of the
resampling method, and of ways to teach it. This material is intended
mainly for the instructor; because the method is new and revolutionary,
many instructors appreciate this guidance. But this didactic material is
also intended to help the student get actively involved in the learning
process rather than just sitting like a baby bird with its beak open
waiting for the mother bird to drop morsels into its mouth. You may skip
this didactic material, of course, and I hope that it does not get in
your way. But all things considered, I decided it was better to include
this material early on rather than to put it in the back or in a
separate publication where it might be overlooked.

## Brief history of statistics {-}

In ancient times, mathematics developed from the needs of governments
and rich men to number armies, flocks, and especially to count the
taxpayers and their possessions. Up until the beginning of the 20th
century, the term *statistic* meant the number of something — soldiers,
births, taxes, or what-have-you. In many cases, the term *statistic* still
means the number of something; the most important statistics for the United
States are in the *Statistical Abstract of the United States* . These numbers
are now known as descriptive statistics. This book will not deal at all with
the making or interpretation of descriptive statistics, because the topic is
handled very well in most conventional statistics texts.

Another stream of thought entered the field of probability and statistics in
the 17th century by way of gambling in France. Throughout history people had
learned about the odds in gambling games by repeated plays of the game. But in
the year 1654, the French nobleman Chevalier de Mere asked the great
mathematician and philosopher Pascal to help him develop correct odds for some
gambling games. Pascal, the famous Fermat, and others went on to develop
modern probability theory.

Later these two streams of thought came together. Researchers wanted to
know how accurate their descriptive statistics were — not only the
descriptive statistics originating from sample surveys, but also the
numbers arising from experiments. Statisticians began to apply the
theory of probability to the accuracy of the data arising from sample
surveys and experiments, and that became the theory of *inferential
statistics* .

Here we find a guidepost: probability theory and statistics are relevant
whenever there is uncertainty about events occurring in the world, or in
the numbers describing those events.

Later, probability theory was also applied to another context in which
there is uncertainty — decision-making situations. Descriptive
statistics like those gathered by insurance companies — for example, the
number of people per thousand in each age bracket who die in a five-year
period — have been used for a long time in making decisions such as how
much to charge for insurance policies. But in the modern probabilistic
theory of decision-making in business, politics and war, the emphasis is
different; in such situations the emphasis is on methods of *combining*
estimates of probabilities that depend upon each other in complicated ways in
order to arrive at the best decision. This is a return to the gambling origins
of probability and statistics. In contrast, in standard insurance situations
(not including war insurance or insurance on a dancer's legs) the
probabilities can be estimated with good precision without complex
calculation, on the basis of a great many observations, and the main
statistical task is gathering the information. In business and political
decision-making situations, however, one often works with probabilities based
on very limited information — often little better than guesses. There the
task is how best to combine these guesses about various probabilities into an
overall probability estimate.

Estimating probabilities with conventional mathematical methods is often
so complex that the process scares many people. And properly so, because
its difficulty leads to errors. The statistics profession worries
greatly about the widespread use of conventional tests whose foundations
are poorly understood. The wide availability of statistical computer
packages that can easily perform these tests with a single command,
regardless of whether the user understands what is going on or whether
the test is appropriate, has exacerbated this problem. This led John
Tukey to turn the field toward descriptive statistics with his
techniques of "exploratory data analysis" [@tukey1977exploratory]. These
descriptive methods are well described in many texts.

Probabilistic analysis also is crucial, however. Judgments about whether
the government should allow a new medicine on the market, or whether an
operator should adjust a screw machine, require more than eyeball
inspection of data to assess the chance variability. But until now the
teaching of probabilistic statistics, with its abstruse structure of
mathematical formulas, mysterious tables of calculations, and
restrictive assumptions concerning data distributions — all of which
separate the student from the actual data or physical process under
consideration — have been an insurmountable obstacle to intuitive
understanding.

Now, however, the resampling method enables researchers and
decision-makers in all walks of life to obtain the benefits of
statistics and predictability without the shortcomings of conventional
methods, free of mathematical formulas and restrictive assumptions.
Resampling's repeated experimental trials on the computer enable the
data (or a data-generating mechanism representing a hypothesis) to
express their own properties, without difficult and misleading
assumptions.

So — good luck.  I hope that you enjoy the book and profit from it.
