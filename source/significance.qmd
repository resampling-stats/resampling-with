# The Concept of Statistical Significance in Testing Hypotheses

*This chapter offers an interpretation of the meaning of the concept of
statistical significance and the term "significant" in connection with
the logic of significance tests. It also discusses the concept of "level
of significance."*

## The logic of hypothesis tests

Let's address the logic of hypothesis tests by considering a variety of
examples in everyday thinking:

Consider the nine-year-old who tells the teacher that the dog ate the
homework. Why does the teacher not accept the child's excuse? Clearly it
is because the event would be too "unusual." But why do we think that
way?

Let's speculate that you survey a million adults, and only three report
that they have ever heard of a real case where a dog ate somebody's
homework. You are a teacher, and a student comes in without homework and
says that a dog ate the homework. It could have happened — your survey
reports that it really has happened in three lifetimes out of a million.
But the event happens *only very infrequently* .

Therefore, you probably conclude that because the event is so unlikely,
something else must have happened — and the likeliest alternative is
that the student did not do the homework. The logic is that if an event
seems very unlikely, it would therefore surprise us greatly if it were
to actually happen, and therefore we assume that there must be a better
explanation. This is why we look askance at unlikely coincidences when
they are to someone's benefit.

The same line of reasoning was the logic of John Arbuthnot's hypothesis
test about the ratio of births by sex in the first published hypothesis
test, though his extension of his logic to God's design as an
alternative hypothesis goes beyond the standard modern framework. It is
also the implicit logic in the research on puerperal fever, cholera, and
beri-beri, the data for which were shown in Chapter 11, though no
explicit mention was made of probability in those cases.

Two students sat next to each other at an ACT college-entrance
examination in Kentucky in 1987. Out of 219 questions, 211 of the
answers were identical, including many that were wrong. Student A was a
high school athlete in Kentucky who had failed two previous SAT exams,
and Student B thought he saw Student A copying from him. Should one
believe that Student A cheated? ( *The Washington Post* , April 19,
1992, p. D2.)

You say to yourself: It would be most unlikely that the two test-takers
would answer that many questions identically by chance — and we can
compute how unlikely that event would be. Because that event is so
unlikely, we therefore conclude that one or both cheated. And indeed,
the testing service invalidated the athlete's exam. On the other hand,
if all the questions that were answered identically were *correct* , the
result might not be unreasonable. If we knew in how many cases they made
the *same mistakes* , the inquiry would have been clearer, but the
newspaper did not contain those details.

The court is hearing a murder case. There is no eye-witness, and the
evidence consists of such facts as the height and weight and age of the
person charged, and other circumstantial evidence. Only one person in 50
million has such characteristics, and you find such a person. Will you
convict the person, or will you believe that the evidence was just a
coincidence? Of course the evidence *might* have occurred by bad luck,
but the probability is very, very small (1 in 50 million). Will you
therefore conclude that because the chance is so small, it is reasonable
to assume that the person charged committed the crime?

Sometimes the unusual really happens — the court errs by judging that
the wrong person did it, and that person goes to prison or even is
executed. The best we can do is to make the criterion strict: "Beyond a
reasonable doubt." (People ask: What

**240** *Resampling: The New Statistics*

probability does that criterion represent? But the court will not
provide a numerical answer.)

Somebody says to you: I am going to deal out five cards and it will be a
royal flush — ten, jack, queen, king, and ace of the same suit. The
person deals the cards and lo and behold! the royal flush appears. Do
you think the occurrence happened just by chance? No, you are likely to
be very dubious that it happened by chance. Therefore, you believe there
must be some other explanation — that the person fixed the cards, for
example.

Note: You don't attach the same meaning to any *other* permutation (say
3, 6, 7, 7, and king of various suits), even though that permutation is
just as rare — unless the person announced exactly that permutation in
advance.

Indeed, even if the person says *nothing* , you will be surprised at a
royal flush, because this hand has *meaning* , whereas another given set
of five cards do not have any special meaning.

You see six Volvos in one home's driveway, and you conclude that it is a
Volvo club meeting, or a Volvo salesperson's meeting. Why? Because it is
unlikely that six people not connected formally by Volvo ownership would
be friends of the same person.

Two important points complicate the concept of statistical significance:

1.  With a large enough sample, *every* treatment or variable will seem
    different from every other. Two faces of even a good die (say, "1"
    and "2") will produce different results in the very very long run.

2.  Statistical significance does not imply economic or social
    significance. Two faces of a die may be statistically different in a
    huge sample of throws, but a 1/10,000 difference between them is too
    small to make an economic difference in betting. Statistical
    significance is only a *filter* . If it appears, one should then
    proceed to decide whether there is *substantive* significance.

Interpreting statistical significance is sometimes complex, especially
when the interpretation depends heavily upon your prior
expectations — as it often does. For example, how should a basketball
coach decide whether or not to bench a player for poor performance after
a series of missed shots at the basket?

Consider Coach John Thompson who, after Charles Smith missed 10 of 12
shots in the 1989 Georgetown-Notre Dame NCAA game, took Smith out of the
game for a time ( *The Washington Post* , March 20, 1989, p. C1). The
scientific or decision problem is: Should the coach consider that Smith
is not now a 47 percent shooter as he normally is, and therefore the
coach should bench him? The statistical question is: How likely is a
shooter with a 47 percent average to produce 10 of 12 misses? The key
issue in the statistical question concerns the total number of shot
attempts we should consider.

Would Coach Thompson take Smith out of the game after he missed *one*
shot? Clearly not. Why not? Because one "expects" Smith to miss a shot
half the time, and missing one shot therefore does not seem unusual.

How about after Smith misses two shots in a row? For the same reason the
coach still would not bench him, because this event happens
"often" — more specifically, about once in every sequence of four shots.

How about after 9 misses out of ten shots? Notice the difference between
this case and 9 females among ten calves. In the case of the calves, we
expected half females because the experiment is a single isolated trial.
The event *considered by itself* has a small enough probability that it
seems *unexpected* rather than expected. ("Unexpected" seems to be
closely related to "happens seldom" or "unusual" in our psychology.) And
an event that happens seldom seems to call for explanation, and also
seems to promise that it will yield itself to explanation by some
unusual concatenation of forces. That is, unusual events lead us to
think that they have unusual causes; that is the nub of the matter. (But
on the other hand, one can sometimes benefit by paying attention to
unusual events, as scientists know when they investigate outliers.)

In basketball shooting, we expect 47 percent of Smith's *individual*
shots to be successful, and we also expect that average for each set of
shots. But we also expect *some* sets of shots to be far from that
average because we observe many sets; such variation is inevitable. So
when we see a single set of 9 misses in ten shots, we are not very
surprised.

But how about 29 misses in 30 shots? At some point, one must start to
pay attention. (And of course we would pay more attention if beforehand,
and never at any other time, the player said, "I can't see the basket
today. My eyes are dim.")

**242** *Resampling: The New Statistics*

So, how should one proceed? Perhaps proceed the same way as with a coin
that keeps coming down heads a very large proportion of the throws, over
a long series of tosses: At *some* point you examine it to see if it has
two heads. But if your investigation is negative, in the absence of an
indication *other than the behavior in question* , you continue to
believe that there is no explanation and you assume that the event is
"chance" and *should not be acted upon* . In the same way, a coach might
*ask* a player if there is an explanation for the many misses. But if
the player answers "no," the coach should not bench him. (There are
difficulties here with truth-telling, of course, but let that go for
now.)

The key point for the basketball case and other repetitive situations is
not to judge that there is an unusual explanation from the behavior of a
*single sample alone* , just as with a short sequence of stock-price
changes.

We all need to learn that "irregular" (a good word here) sequences are
less unusual than they seem to the naked intuition. A streak of 10 out
of 12 misses for a 47 percent shooter occurs about 3 percent of the
time. That is, about every 33 shots Smith takes, he will begin a
sequence of 12 shots that will end with 3 or fewer baskets — perhaps
once in every couple of games. This does not seem "very" unusual,
perhaps. And if the coach *treats* each such case as unusual, he will be
losing some of the services of a better player than he replaces him
with.

In brief, how hard one should search for an explanation should depend on
the probability of the event. But one should (almost) assume the absence
of an explanation unless one actually finds it.

Bayesian analysis could be brought to bear upon the matter, bringing in
your prior probabilities based on the knowledge of research that has
shown that there is no such thing as a "hot hand" in basketball (see
Chapter 9), together with some sort of cost-benefit error-loss
calculation comparing Smith and the next best available player.

## The concept of statistical significance

"Significance level" is a common term in probability statistics. It
corresponds roughly to the probability that the assumed benchmark
universe could give rise to a sample as extreme as the observed sample
by chance. The results of Example 16-1 would be phrased as follows: The
hypothesis that the radiation treatment affects the sex of the fruit fly
offspring is accepted as true at the probability level of .16 (sometimes
stated as the 16 percent level of significance). (A more common way of
expressing this idea would be to say that the hypothesis is *not
rejected* at the .16 probability level or the 16 percent level of
significance. But "not rejected" and "accepted" really do mean much the
same thing, despite some arguments to the contrary.) This kind of
statistical work is called hypothesis testing.

The question of *which* significance level should be considered
"significant" is difficult. How great must a coincidence be before you
refuse to believe that it is only a coincidence? It has been
conventional in social science to say that if the probability that
something happens by chance is less than 5 percent, it is significant.
But sometimes the stiffer standard of 1 percent is used. Actually, *any*
fixed cut-off significance level is arbitrary. (And even the whole
notion of saying that a hypothesis "is true" or "is not true" is
sometimes not useful.) Whether a one-tailed or two-tailed test is used
will influence your significance level, and this is why care must be
taken in making that choice.
