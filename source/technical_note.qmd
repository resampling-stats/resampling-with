# Technical Note to the Professional Reader

The material presented in this book fits together with the technical
literature as follows: Though I had proceeded from first principles
rather than from the literature, I have from the start cited work by
J.H. Chung and D.A.S. Fraser (1958) and Meyer Dwass (1957). They
suggested taking samples of permutations in a two-sample test as a way
of extending the applicability of Fisher's randomization test.
Resampling with replacement from a single sample to determine sample
statistic variability was suggested by Simon (1969). Independent work by
Efron (1979) explored the properties of this technique (Efron termed it
the "bootstrap") and lent it theoretical support. The notion of using
these techniques routinely and in preference to conventional techniques
based on Gaussian assumptions was suggested by Simon (1969) and by
Simon, Atkinson, and Shevokas (1976).
