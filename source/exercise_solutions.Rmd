## Solution for [paired differences exercise @sec-exr-paired-differences] {#sec-soln-paired-differences}

We suggested that you ignored the pairing of the before and after samples, and that is what we will do here.  Then we will extend the treatment to take the pairing into account.

Finally we consider the pairs.  Here we *do* take the pairs into account.  We
have some reason to think that the patients or cars vary in some substantial way in their level of depression, or their tendency to break down, but we believe that the patients' *response* to treatment or the difference between the mechanics is the value of interest.

In that case, we are interested in the *differences* between the pairs.  In the
null world, these before / after (mechanic A / mechanic B) differences are
random.  In the null-world, where there is no difference between before/after
or mechanics 1 and 2, we can flip the before / after (A / B) pairs and be in
the same world.

Notice that flipping the before / after or A / B in the pair just changes the
sign of the difference.

So we will simulate the effect of flipping the values in the pair, by choosing
a random sign for the pair, where -1 means pair is flipped, and 1 means pair is
in original order.   We recalculated the mean difference with these random
signs (flips) applied, and these will be our values in the null-world.

```{python}
# A test of paired difference with sign flips for the null world.
differences = after - before
observed_mdiff = np.mean(differences)
n_both = len(differences)

results = np.zeros(n_trials)
for i in range(n_trials):
    # Choose random signs to perform random flips of the pairs.
    signs = rnd.choice([-1, 1], size=n_both)
    # Do flips.
    fake_differences = signs * differences
    # Calculate mean difference and store result.
    results[i] = np.mean(fake_differences)

k = np.sum(np.abs(results) >= np.abs(observed_mdiff))
kk = k / n_trials
print('Sign-flip p null-world abs >= abs observed:', kk)
```

```{r}
# A test of paired difference with sign flips for the null world.
differences <- after - before
observed_mdiff <- mean(differences)
n_both <- length(differences)

results <- numeric(n_trials)
for (i in 1:n_trials) {
    # Choose random signs to perform random flips of the pairs.
    signs <- sample(c(-1, 1), size=n_both, replace=TRUE)
    # Do flips.
    fake_differences <- signs * differences
    # Calculate mean difference and store result.
    results[i] <- mean(fake_differences)
}

k <- sum(abs(results) >= abs(observed_mdiff))
kk <- k / n_trials
message('Sign-flip p null-world abs >= abs observed: ', kk)
```

Notice that the sign-flip test, in which we preserve the information about the patients / cars, is much more convincing than the permutation or bootstrap tests above, where we choose to ignore that information.

This can occur when the values within the pairs (rows) are similar to each
other, but less similar across different pairs (rows).

## Solution for [battery lifetime @sec-exr-battery-lifetime] {#sec-soln-battery-lifetime}

Establish a 95 percent confidence interval for the true average value. The

## Solution for [voter participation @sec-exr-voter-participation] {#sec-soln-voter-participation}

The observed correlation coefficient between voter participation and spread is
moderate and negative. Is this more negative that what might occur by chance,
if no correlation exists in some underlying population, from which this sample
was taken?

1.  Create two groups of paper cards: 25 with participation rates, and
    25 with the spread values. Arrange the cards in pairs in accordance
    with the table, and compute the correlation coefficient between the
    shuffled participation and spread variables.
2.  Shuffle one of the sets, say that with participation, and compute
    correlation between shuffled participation and spread.
3.  Repeat step 2 many, say 1000, times. Compute the proportion of the
    trials in which correlation was at least as negative as that for the
    original data.

From this we may conclude that the voter participation rates probably are
negatively related to the vote spread in the election. The actual value of the
correlation (-.425) cannot be explained by chance alone. In our Monte Carlo
simulation of the null-hypothesis a correlation that negative is found only
about 3 percent of the time.

Interpretation: In 10,000 simulations, random shuffling very rarely produced
a value as high as observed. Therefore, we conclude that random chance could
not reasonably be responsible for the observed degree of correlation.

Interpretation: a correlation coefficient as high as the observed value
(.62) occurred only about 0.3% of the time by chance. Hence, provisionally, we
choose to reject chance as an explanation for such a high value of the
correlation coefficient.

Notice, we get the same answer for correlation coefficients as we do for sum of
products. In fact, correlation coefficients must give us the same answer (apart
from random variation from the permutation), as the tests of association are
equivalent when we compare between different orderings of the same sequences.

Interpretation: The observed correlation (.42) between the exchange rate and
the money supply is seldom exceeded by random experiments with these data.
Thus, the observed result 0.42 cannot be reasonably explained by chance alone
and we conclude that it is statistically surprising.
