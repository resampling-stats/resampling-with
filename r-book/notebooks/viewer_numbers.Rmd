# Number of viewers


The notebook calculates the expected number of viewers in a sample of
400, given that there is a 30% chance of any one person being a viewer,
and then calculates how far that value is from 120.

```{r}
# set the number of trials
n_trials <- 10000

# an empty array to store the scores
scores <- numeric(n_trials)

# What are the options to choose from?
options <- c('viewer', 'not viewer')

# do n_trials trials
for (i in 1:n_trials) {

    # Choose 'viewer' 30% of the time.
    a <- sample(options, size=400, prob=c(0.3, 0.7), replace=TRUE)

    # count the viewers
    b <- sum(a == 'viewer')

    # how different from expected?
    c <- 120 - b

    # absolute value of the difference
    d <- abs(c)

    # express as a proportion of sample
    e <- d / 400

    # keep score of the result
    scores[i] <- e
}

# find the mean divergence
k <- mean(scores)

# Show the result
k
