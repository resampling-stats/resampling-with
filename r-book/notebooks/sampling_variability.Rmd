# Experiment in sampling variability


Try generating some rookie “seasons” yourself with the following
commands, ranging the batter’s “true” performance by changing the value
of `p_hit` (the probability of a hit).

```{r}
# Simulate a rookie season of 400 at-bats.

# You might try changing the value below and rerunning.
# This is the true (long-run) probability of a hit for this batter.
p_hit <- 0.4
message('True average is: ', p_hit)
```

```{r}
# We resample _with_ replacement here; the chances of a hit do not change
# From at-bat to at-bat.
at_bats <- sample(c('Hit', 'Out'), prob=c(p_hit, 1 - p_hit), size=400, replace=TRUE)
simulated_average <- sum(at_bats == 'Hit') / 400
# Show the result
message('Simulated average is: ', simulated_average)
```

Simulate a set of 10 or 20 such rookie seasons, and look at the one who
did best. How did their rookie season compare to their “true” average?
