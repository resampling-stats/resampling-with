# Two pairs


We count the number of times we get two pairs in a random hand of five
cards.

```{r}
deck <- rep(1:13, 4)
```

```{r}
pairs_per_trial <- numeric(10000)

# Repeat the following steps 10000 times
for (i in 1:10000) {
    # Shuffle the deck
    shuffled <- sample(deck)

    # Take the first five cards.
    hand <- shuffled[1:5]

    # How many pairs?
    # Counts for each card rank.
    repeat_nos <- tabulate(hand)
    n_pairs <- sum(repeat_nos == 2)

    # Keep score of # of pairs
    pairs_per_trial[i] <- n_pairs

    # End loop, go back and repeat
}

# How often were there 2 pairs?
n_two_pairs <- sum(pairs_per_trial == 2)

# Convert to proportion
print(n_two_pairs / 10000)
```
