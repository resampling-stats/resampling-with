# Female calf numbers simulation


This notebook uses simulation to test the null hypothesis that the
chances of any one calf being female is 100 / 206.

```{r}
# Set the number of trials.
n_trials <- 10000

# Set the size of each sample.
sample_size <- 10

# Probability of any one calf being female.
p_female <- 100 / 206

# A vector to store the results.
scores <- numeric(n_trials)

# for 10000 repeats.
for (i in 1:n_trials) {

    a <- sample(c('female', 'male'),
                size=sample_size,
                prob=c(p_female, 1 - p_female),
                replace=TRUE)
    b <- sum(a == 'female')

    # Store the result of the current trial.
    scores[i] <- b
}

# Plot a histogram of the scores.
title_of_plot <- paste0("Number of females in", n_trials, " samples of \n", sample_size, " simulated calves")
hist(scores, xlab = 'Number of Females', main=title_of_plot)

# Count the number of scores that were greater than or equal to 9.
k <- sum(scores >= 9)

# Express as a proportion.
kk <- k / n_trials

# Show the proportion.
message("Probability of 9 or 10 females occurring by chance: ", kk)
```

We read from the result in variable `kk` that the probability of 9 or 10
females occurring by chance is a bit more than one percent.
