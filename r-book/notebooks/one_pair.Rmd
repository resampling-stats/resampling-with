# One pair


This is a simulation to find the probability of exactly one pair in a
poker hand of five cards.

```{r}
# Create a bucket (vector) called a with four "1's," four "2's," four "3's,"
# etc., to represent a deck of cards
one_suit = 1:13
one_suit
```

```{r}
# Repeat values for one suit four times to make a 52 card deck of values.
deck <- rep(one_suit, 4)
deck
```

```{r}
# Vector to store result of each trial.
z <- numeric(10000)

# Repeat the following steps 10000 times
for (i in 1:10000) {
    # Shuffle the deck
    shuffled <- sample(deck)

    # Take the first five cards to make a hand.
    hand = shuffled[1:5]

    # How many pairs?
    # Counts for each card rank.
    repeat_nos <- tabulate(hand)
    n_pairs <- sum(repeat_nos == 2)

    # Keep score of # of pairs
    z[i] <- n_pairs

    # End loop, go back and repeat
}

# How often was there 1 pair?
k <- sum(z == 1)

# Convert to proportion.
kk = k / 10000

# Show the result.
message(kk)
```
