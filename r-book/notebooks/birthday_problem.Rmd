# The Birthday Problem


Here we answer the question: “What is the probability that two or more
people among a roomful of (say) twenty-five people will have the same
birthday?”

```{r}
n_with_same_birthday <- numeric(10000)

# All the days of the year from "1" through "365"
all_days <- 1:365

# Do 10000 trials (experiments)
for (i in 1:10000) {
    # Generate 25 numbers randomly between "1" and "365," put them in a.
    a <- sample(all_days, size=25, replace=TRUE)

    # Looking in a, count the number of multiples and put the result in
    # "counts".
    counts <- tabulate(a)

    # We request multiples > 1 because we are interested in any multiple,
    # whether it is a duplicate, triplicate, etc. Had we been interested only
    # in duplicates, we would have put in sum(counts == 2).
    n_duplicates <- sum(counts > 1)

    # Score the result of each trial to our store
    n_with_same_birthday[i] <- n_duplicates

    # End the loop for the trial, go back and repeat the trial until all 10000
    # are complete, then proceed.
}

# Determine how many trials had at least one multiple.
k <- sum(n_with_same_birthday)

# Convert to a proportion.
kk <- k / 10000

# Print the result.
message(kk)
```
