# Three of a kind


We count the number of times we get three of a kind in a random hand of
five cards.

```{r}
one_suit <- 1:13
deck <- rep(one_suit, 4)
```

```{r}
triples_per_trial <- numeric(10000)

# Repeat the following steps 10000 times
for (i in 1:10000) {
    # Shuffle the deck
    shuffled <- sample(deck)

    # Take the first five cards.
    hand <- shuffled[1:5]

    # How many triples?
    repeat_nos <- tabulate(hand)
    n_triples <- sum(repeat_nos == 3)

    # Keep score of # of triples
    triples_per_trial[i] <- n_triples

    # End loop, go back and repeat
}

# How often was there 1 pair?
n_triples <- sum(triples_per_trial == 1)

# Convert to proportion
message(n_triples / 10000)
```
