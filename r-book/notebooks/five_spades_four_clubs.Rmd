# Five spades and four clubs


**This is an example of multiple-outcome sampling without replacement,
order does not matter**.

The problem is similar to the example in
<a href="#sec-four-girls-one-boy" class="quarto-xref"><span
class="quarto-unresolved-ref">sec-four-girls-one-boy</span></a>, except
that now there are four equally-likely outcomes instead of only two. An
R solution is:

```{r}
# Constitute the deck of 52 cards.
# Repeat the suit names 13 times each, to make a 52 card deck.
deck <- rep(c('spade', 'club', 'diamond', 'heart'), c(13, 13, 13, 13))
# Show the deck
deck
```

```{r}
N <- 10000
trial_results <- numeric(N)

# Repeat the trial N times.
for (i in 1:N) {

    # Shuffle the deck and draw 13 cards.
    hand <- sample(deck, 13)  # replace=FALSE is the default.

    # Count the number of spades in "hand", put the result in "n_spades".
    n_spades <- sum(hand == 'spade')

    # If we have five spades, we'll continue on to count the clubs. If we don't
    # have five spades, the number of clubs is irrelevant â€” we have not gotten
    # the hand we are interested in.
    if (n_spades == 5) {
        # Count the clubs, put the result in "n_clubs"
        n_clubs <- sum(hand == 'club')
        # Keep track of the number of clubs in each trial
        trial_results[i] <- n_clubs
    }

    # End one experiment, go back and repeat until all N trials are done.
}

# Count the number of trials where we got 4 clubs. This is the answer we want -
# the number of hands out of 1000 with 5 spades and 4 clubs. (Recall that we
# only counted the clubs if the hand already had 5 spades.)
n_5_and_4 <- sum(trial_results == 4)

# Convert to a proportion.
prop_5_and_4 <- n_5_and_4 / N

# Print the result
message(prop_5_and_4)
```
