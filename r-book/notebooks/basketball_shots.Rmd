# Three or more basketball shots


We simulate the probability of scoring three or more baskets from five
shots, if each shot has a 25% probability of success.

```{r}
n_baskets <- numeric(10000)

# Do 10000 experimental trials.
for (i in 1:10000) {

    # Generate 5 random numbers, each between 1 and 4, put them in "a".
    # Let "1" represent a basket, "2" through "4" be a miss.
    a <- sample(1:4, size=5, replace=TRUE)

    # Count the number of baskets, put that result in b.
    b <- sum(a == 1)

    # Keep track of each experiment's results in z.
    n_baskets[i] <- b

    # End the experiment, go back and repeat until all 10000 are completed, then
    # proceed.
}

# Determine how many experiments produced more than two baskets, put that
# result in k.
n_more_than_2 <- sum(n_baskets > 2)

# Convert to a proportion.
prop_more_than_2 <- n_more_than_2 / 10000

# Print the result.
message(prop_more_than_2)
