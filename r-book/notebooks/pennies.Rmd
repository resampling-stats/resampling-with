# Simulating the pennies game


This notebook calculates the probability that one player will run out of
pennies within 200 turns of the Pennies game.

```{r}
someone_won <- numeric(10000)

# Do 10000 trials
for (i in 1:10000) {

    # Record the number 10: a's stake
    a_stake <- 10

    # Same for b
    b_stake <- 10

    # An indicator flag that will be set to "1" when somebody wins.
    flag <- 0

    # Repeat the following steps 200 times.
    # Notice we use "j" as the counter variable, to avoid overwriting
    # "i", the counter variable for the 10000 trials.
    for (j in 1:200) {
        # Generate the equivalent of a coin flip, letting 1 <- heads,
        # 2 <- tails
        c <- sample(1:2, size=1)

        # If it's a heads
        if (c == 1) {

            # Add 1 to b's stake
            b_stake <- b_stake + 1

            # Subtract 1 from a's stake
            a_stake <- a_stake - 1

            # End the "if" condition
        }

        # If it's a tails
        if (c == 2) {

            # Add one to a's stake

            b_stake <- b_stake - 1

            # End the "if" condition
        }

        # If a has won
        if (a_stake == 20) {

        # End the repeat loop for 200 plays (note that the indicator flag stays
        # at 0 if neither a nor b has won)
    }

    # Keep track of whether anybody won.
    someone_won[i] <- flag

    # End the 10000 trials
}

# Find out how often somebody won
n_wins <- sum(someone_won)

# Convert to a proportion
prop_wins <- n_wins / 10000

# Print the results
