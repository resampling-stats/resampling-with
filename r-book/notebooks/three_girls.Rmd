# Three Girls


This notebook estimates the probability that a family of four children
will have exactly three girls.

```{r}
girl_counts <- numeric(10000)

# Do 10000 trials
for (i in 1:10000) {

    # Select 'girl' or 'boy' at random, four times.
    children <- sample(c('girl', 'boy'), size=4, replace=TRUE)

    # Count the number of girls and put the result in b.
    b <- sum(children == 'girl')

    # Keep track of each trial result in z.
    girl_counts[i] <- b

    # End this trial, repeat the experiment until 10000 trials are complete,
    # then proceed.
}

# Count the number of experiments where we got exactly 3 girls, and put this
# result in k.
n_three_girls <- sum(girl_counts == 3)

# Convert to a proportion.
three_girls_prop <- n_three_girls / 10000

# Print the results.
message(three_girls_prop)
