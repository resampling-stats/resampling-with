# Public and private liquor prices


This notebook asks the question whether the difference in the means of
private and government-specified prices of a particular whiskey could
plausibly have come about as a result of random sampling.

```{r}
fake_diffs <- numeric(10000)

priv <- c(4.82, 5.29, 4.89, 4.95, 4.55, 4.90, 5.25, 5.30, 4.29, 4.85, 4.54,
          4.75, 4.85, 4.85, 4.50, 4.75, 4.79, 4.85, 4.79, 4.95, 4.95, 4.75,
          5.20, 5.10, 4.80, 4.29)

govt <- c(4.65, 4.55, 4.11, 4.15, 4.20, 4.55, 3.80, 4.00, 4.19, 4.75, 4.74,
          4.50, 4.10, 4.00, 5.05, 4.20)

actual_diff <- mean(priv) - mean(govt)

# Join the two vectors of data
both <- c(priv, govt)

# Repeat 10000 simulation trials
for (i in 1:10000) {

    # Sample 26 with replacement for private group
    fake_priv <- sample(both, size=26, replace=TRUE)

    # Sample 16 with replacement for govt. group
    fake_govt <- sample(both, size=16, replace=TRUE)

    # Find the mean of the "private" group.
    p <- mean(fake_priv)

    # Mean of the "govt." group
    g <- mean(fake_govt)

    # Difference in the means
    diff <- p - g

    # Keep score of the trials
    fake_diffs[i] <- diff
}

# Graph of simulation results to compare with the observed result.

                   round(actual_diff * 100),
                   'cents')
hist(fake_diffs, main=fig_title, xlab='Difference in average prices (cents)')
