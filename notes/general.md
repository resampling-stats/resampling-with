# Notes

## Operational definition

See [Stanford dictionary of philosophy article](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/operationalism):

> We evidently know what we mean by length if we can tell what the length of
> any and every object is, and for the physicist nothing more is required. To
> find the length of an object, we have to perform certain physical operations.
> The concept of length is therefore fixed when the operations by which length is
> measured are fixed: that is, the concept of length involves as much as and
> nothing more than the set of operations by which length is determined. In
> general, we mean by any concept nothing more than a set of operations; the
> concept is synonymous with the corresponding set of operations. (Bridgman
> 1927, 5)

An *operational definition* of *X* is a definition of *X* in terms of the
procedure used to measure *X*.

## Julian Simon and the origin of the bootstrap

> The idea of resampling from the empirical distribution to form a Monte Carlo
> approximation to the bootstrap estimate may have been thought of and used prior
> to Efron. Simon (1969) has been referenced by some to indicate his use of the
> idea as a tool in teaching elementary statistics prior to Efron. Bruce and
> Simon have been instrumental in popularizing the bootstrap approach through
> their company Resampling Stats Inc. and their associated software. They also
> continue to use the Monte Carlo approximation to the bootstrap as a tool for
> introducing statistical concepts in a first elementary course in statistics
> [see Simon and Bruce (1991, 1995)]. Julian Simon died several years ago; but
> Peter Bruce continues to run the company and in addition to teaching resampling
> in online courses, he has set up a faculty to teach a variety of online
> statistics courses.
>
> It is clear, however, that widespread use of the methods (particularly by
> professional statisticians) along with the many theoretical developments
> occurred only after Efron's 1979 work. That paper (Efron, 1979a) connected the
> simple bootstrap idea to established methods for estimating the standard error
> of an estimator, namely, the jackknife, cross-validation, and the delta method,
> thus providing the theoretical underpinnings that that were then further
> developed by Efron and other researchers.

Simon.

> In 1969, his pro- motion of resampling methods for testing statistical
> hypotheses must have seemed only moderately practical. Nevertheless, his
> prediction that this approach "holds great promise for the future" (Simon,
> 1969) cannot be faulted.

## Thoughts

### Do we need to introduce the normal distribution?

How about approximations based on the normal distribution?

Mentioned in chapters 3, 12, 15, 16, 18-23, 25.

[Discussion of capitalization of normal](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/173458/should-i-capitalise-the-n-in-normal-distribution-in-british-english) as in "normal distribution".

### Standard deviation

Standard deviation mentioned in a quote by Kinsey in the introduction, and a footnote in chapter 6, but not thereafter until chapter 18, where it is defined, with variance, very briefly.  Then mentioned as measure of spread in chapter 19, and used to make Z scores.

Thence mentioned a couple of times in chapters 20 and 21 (confidence intervals).

## Central Limit Theorem

* Mentioned as to be explained in Chapter 3, with Normal
  distribution, but not explained later.

## Bootstrap

Mentioned in preface, thence chapters 7, 12, 14, 15, 18, 21, 24, 25.  Check definition.

## Code topics

* Comments after code lines - as in `print(a)  # Print the result`
  (sampling_tools).
* strings (sampling_tools)
* arrays and data types (sampling_tools)
* lists (done in sampling_tools)
* indentation (maybe in resampling_with_code2 and for loops)
* bincount / tabulate (probability_theory_2_compound).
* Maybe more on Boolean arrays.
* (a == 1) & (b == 3) (probability_theory_3 or before).
* Python `range` cf `np.arange` (resampling_with_code)
* `np.all` (done in `probabality_theory_4_finite`).
* Need `plt.hist`, at least by `probabality_theory_4_finite`.  We should
  probably have a section or even a chapter on histograms.
